Going through the course, students tend to ask for more content and resources than just the course material. We have compiled a list of useful resources for the students to help in learning more about development and being a developer. Even though these resources are not needed to be a good developer and a junior may not understand everything, they help juniors get exposure to new ideas and help start meaningful conversations with other developers.
