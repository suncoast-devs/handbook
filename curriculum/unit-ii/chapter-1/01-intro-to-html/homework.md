# It all starts with HTML

During ths week, you will be building a website for your new chain of restaurants. This will have a few pages and will serve for us as a playground to learn about web development.

All web pages have to start somewhere, and this site is no different. To start off, you will be laying the groundwork for the days to come.

To start, you will need to start with the HTML and content.

[Here is a sample](XXXXX)

### Requirements

  - [ ] a navbar
  - [ ] a ["hero"](https://www.sitepoint.com/exploring-hero-section/) section
