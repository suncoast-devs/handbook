## This Journey

This will be an amazing journey, full of highs and lows. Here's some topics/articles to read through as you mentally prep yourself to begin class:

### Read how to ask good questions:

This is very important on your growth here with SDG and beyond. Asking questions is something that will happen on a regular basis. Learn how to ask the right questions.

### Everyone has something to teach...

...even if someone participates with "just a question", it benefits the classroom and yourself. Chances are that someone else has that question. Great learners ask great questions – never forget that!

### Automating, scheduling, and decision fatigue

We are hardwired to need breaks every 90-120 minutes. Schedule your energy, not your time. Block out parts of your day for exercise, for reading \(fiction\), for cooking, for family, for any nothing not coding related. 

Group similar activities; if you need to do emails, do them in batches. If you need to do an assignment, do it without looking around at websites, checking Facebook/Twitter, or reading emails.

Focus is important.

### There is no excuse to not work on high-priority items first.

To overcome decision fatigue and be more productive in general, Tim Ferriss recommends putting systems and processes in place that automate as much thinking as possible. The goal is to turn open-ended questions \(What am I going to eat for breakfast?\) into if/then statements \(If it’s a weekday, I’m going to have a protein shake for breakfast\).

Adopt the same priorities: as soon as lunch begins, take a mental break, go for a walk, and then get to work and **remove distractions**. Computers give us too many excuses to not focus on our task at hand; don't let them control you.

### Blogging and Branding

You will be asked to regularly blog, reflecting on your voyage and trials here at the academy. You will also be asked to, on occasion, reflect on a reading, on an assignment, or on a video as a homework assignment itself.

Writing about code, about being a developer, about a tool, and so forth gives you leverage. You learn to put into words how you emotionally feel, you understand and reflect, you meditate. Those thoughts, ideas, and takeaways are in essence "pre-meditated" and prepared so that when you rub shoulders with and interview with employers, clients, and customers, you have something eloquent enough to deliver, and memorable enough to recall
