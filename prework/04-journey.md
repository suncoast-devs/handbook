### Everyone has something to teach...

...even if someone participates with "just a question," it benefits the classroom and yourself. The chances are that someone else has that question. Great learners ask great questions – never forget that!

### Automating, scheduling, and decision fatigue

We are hardwired to need breaks every 90-120 minutes. Schedule your energy, not your time. Block out parts of your day for exercise, for reading \(fiction\), for cooking, for family, for any nothing not coding related.

Group similar activities; if you need to do emails, do them in batches. If you need to do an assignment, do it without looking around at websites, checking Facebook/Twitter, or reading emails.

The focus is important.

### There is no excuse to not work on high-priority items first.

To overcome decision fatigue and be more productive in general, Tim Ferriss recommends putting systems and processes in place that automate as much thinking as possible. The goal is to turn open-ended questions \(What am I going to eat for breakfast?\) into if/then statements \(If it’s a weekday, I’m going to have a protein shake for breakfast\).

Adopt the same priorities: as soon as lunch begins, take a mental break, go for a walk, and then get to work and **remove distractions**. Computers give us too many excuses to not focus on our task at hand; don't let them control you.

### Talking the lingo

During your time here, you will be  asked to communicate technical ideas in various ways. During the course, you will be asked blog about various topics, give presentations to your classmates and network with people in the community.   These vary from talking about a technical idea you are using to sharing your journey on learning to be a developer.

Writing, speaking and talking about code, being a developer, a tool you are using, and so forth gives you leverage and knowledge. You learn to put into words what you know, what you don't know, how you emotionally feel and how you can brand yourself. Those thoughts, ideas, and takeaways are in essence "pre-meditated" and prepared so that when you rub shoulders with and interview with, employers, clients, and customers, you have something eloquent enough to deliver, and memorable enough to recall
