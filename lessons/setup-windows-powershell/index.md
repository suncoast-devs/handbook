title: Powershell
---

As a developer on the Windows platform, one of our main tools is `Powershell`.
`Powershell` is the command line interface (or shell) we use to run commands and
interact with our computer. Using the shell seems difficult at first, but with
practice, this becomes a much more efficient way of using our computers.

To open `Powershell`, open your `start` menu or type \(Win + R\), then type
`Powershell`, this searches your system and give you the option to start it,
just like any other program.

## PRO TIP

Since we are going to run this often you may consider pinning it to your screen
by right-clicking the icon in the Task Bar and selecting "Pin to taskbar"
