# Start at the beginning

If we visit `handbook.suncoast.io` how does our browser know where to go?

What are the technologies and processes involved in making this work?

^ In this lesson, we will scratch the surface of the deep stack of technologies, processes, code, services, servers, and protocols needed to make this work.

---

# Domains and Hosts

---

# URL

```
Protocol
  |
  |     Hostname
  |        |
  |        |       Domain Name
  |        |         |
  |        |         |
  v        v         v
https://handbook.suncoast.io
```

# But where is it?

# IP Address

- Once the browser realizes you wish to visit `handbook.suncoast.io` it must figure out how to address the server.

- The internet itself does not deal in terms of names like `handbook.suncoast.io` but in terms of a numerical address in the form `1.2.3.4` or `192.168.145.241`.

---

# DNS

So how does the browser know to find the `IP Address` of `handbook.suncoast.io`?

It uses a service known as `DNS` (`Domain Name Services`).

Every client has a preset list of `IP Addresses` that are equipped to perform a translation of a domain name like `handbook.suncoast.io` into its IP address `104.248.50.87`.

The `DNS` process allows your computer to quickly translate the address.

---

- Checks defined DNS server.
- Likely your local router.
- Sees if it is recently resolved, given "Time To Live" (TTL).
- If not, check's its DNS server. Typically your ISP.

---

# [fit] This is a nice [visualization](https://www.verisign.com/en_US/website-presence/online/how-dns-works/index.xhtml) of the DNS process.

---

# Let's lookup a few addresses

> NOTE: Use `nslookup` if `dig` isn't available.

```
dig handbook.suncoast.io
dig amazon.com
dig www.yahoo.com
```

<br/>

We will see that DNS can return multiple values.
We will see examples of CNAMEs.

---

# Making Connections

---

# [fit] What happens after our computer resolves the address of a server?

- The next thing we need to do is connect to a particular _service_ on that machine.

- Remember when we mentioned that part of the URL is a `protocol`. This also indicates which `service` we want to speak to.

---

# Port Numbers

- Each of these `services` will be _listening_ for a connection from a client on a particular `port number`.

- If you think of the `IP Address` as a street address of an office building, you can think of the `port number` as which room in the building the service is in.

# Sockets

To connect to a service on a port the computer creates something called a `socket`.

A `socket` is a virtual connection between your computer and a port on a remote computer.

Think of it like a pipe that information can flow through in both directions.

Once this socket is established we can _send_ information and we can _receive_ information in return.

---

# How do we connect to one of these ports?

Let's try connecting like the browser does.

For this, we will be using a tool named `netcat`.

- On Mac OS install it with: `brew install nc`
- On Windows install it with: `scoop install netcat`
- On Linux it is likely `sudo apt install netcat`

To connect: `nc handbook.suncoast.io 80`

---

# HTTP

Now that we are connected, how do we talk? We use the `http` protocol that is [well documented.](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616)

^ Show how complex the spec is. And point out the "Updated and Obsoleted"

---

# GET a page

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: handbook.suncoast.io

```

<br/>
<br/>
