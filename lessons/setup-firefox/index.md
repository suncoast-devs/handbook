title: Firefox
---

We recommend using [Firefox](https://firefox.com) during this course.

We are going to be using Firefox's `Development Tools` feature extensively when
developing front end applications. Even if you do not use Firefox for your web
browsing experience, having all of your fellow students on the same development
tools will help.

```shell
brew cask install firefox
