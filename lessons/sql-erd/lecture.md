# Revisiting `PEDAC`

When creating a database-backed system we consider this part of our `Data Structure`

> When modeling our systems, we need to represent real-world things in a format that lends itself to being stored in a relational database. One of our jobs as software developers is understanding the business process and the business problem well enough to accurately model the current problem and create a structure that can bend and change to future requirements.

---

ERD is a way to represent the structure of our business entities in a way that allows us to model our real-world data in database tables and relationships.

---

When working on a business problem, we should be looking for statements that reveal the types and structure of data we want to manage.

---

- Keep track of students, the courses they are taking, and the course's teacher.

- Record the customer's order, the items on each order, and which of the customer's addresses to ship to

- Record the author, time of creation, and contents of the blog post. Also, record comments, including who commented and when

---

Within these descriptions, we are looking for different types of words to help guide us. We should be looking for:

- Nouns: a thing, such as a student, a customer, or an order.
- Verbs: an action, such as enroll or ship.
- Adjectives: a describing word such as posted or approved.

# Components of an ERD

The first component of an ERD is an entity. These typically represent the significant _nouns_ of our system.

<br/>

> "Keep track of students, the courses they are taking, and the course's teacher."

---

```
+---------------+      +---------------+      +---------------+
|               |      |               |      |               |
|    Student    |      |     Course    |      |    Teacher    |
|               |      |               |      |               |
+---------------+      +---------------+      +---------------+
```

---

# Attributes

Next, we will determine the attributes of each of these nouns.

These would be things like

- "the student's name"
- "the student's age"
- "the student's birthday"
- "the course's name"
- "the course's description"
- "the teacher's name."

---

```
+-------------+      +---------------+      +-----------+
|  Student    |      |   Course      |      |  Teacher  |
+-------------+      +---------------+      +-----------+
|  Name       |      |   Name        |      |  Name     |
|  Age        |      |   Description |      |           |
|  Birthday   |      |               |      |           |
+-------------+      +---------------+      +-----------+
```

---

# Naming Things

You'll notice that all the attributes are **singular** named and store **a single value**. If we had a multiple-value attribute of an entity, say multiple phone numbers for a `Teacher`, we'd create another entity to track those.

---

# Data Types

In addition to the names of the attributes, we may also capture the type of data the attribute represents.

- `Name` is text
- `Age` is a number
- `Birthday` is a date

These data types will become column types eventually in our database.

---

# Relationships

After identifying the entities and their attributes, we can identify the relationships

```
+-------------+                     +--------------+                   +-----------+
|  Student    |                     |  Course      |                   |  Teacher  |
+-------------+                     +--------------+                   +-----------+
|  Name       |                     |  Name        |                   |  Name     |
|  Age        | <-- enrolled in --> |  Description | <-- taught by --> |           |
|  Birthday   |                     |              |                   |           |
+-------------+                     +--------------+                   +-----------+
```

---

# Some relationships take more work (and entities)

If we determine that a relationship, in this case, _enrolled in_ needs extra data stored along with it, say the date the student enrolled, we'll create another entity to hold it.

```
+-------------+                  +--------------+                 +--------------+                   +-----------+
|  Student    |                  |  Enrollment  |                 |  Course      |                   |  Teacher  |
+-------------+                  +--------------+                 +--------------+                   +-----------+
|  Name       |                  |  Date        |    assigned     |  Name        |                   |  Name     |
|  Age        | <-- has many --> |              | <-- to one -->  |  Description | <-- taught by --> |           |
|  Birthday   |                  |              |                 |              |                   |           |
+-------------+                  +--------------+                 +--------------+                   +-----------+
```

## Translating to our database

- If we take the time to map out the entities, attributes, and relations in an ERD, we can begin to see the data structure in our application.
- Entity Relationship Diagrams also serve as good documentation for your project and allow you to review with the various _stakeholders_ since the diagrams are also accessible for non-developers to understand (perhaps with a bit of help).
