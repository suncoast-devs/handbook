In CSS you can do a lot to style the background behind your content.

## What exactly is a background?

The background of an element is the area that sits underneath an element's
content, padding, and border.

The background doesn't sit underneath the margin — the margin doesn't count as
part of the element's area, but rather the area outside the element.

There are many other different properties you can use to manipulate the
element's background.

Now let's look at how to use these features in detail.

## The basics: color, image, position, repeat

Let's explore a simple example to show how the four most basic properties work —
you'll use these ones all the time when dealing with backgrounds.

### Background color

<CodePen>

You'll use the background-color property very often:

For a start, the default background color of most elements is not `white` (as
you might expect) but `transparent` — therefore if you set an element's
background color to something interesting, but want its child elements to be
white, you'll have to set that explicitly.

In addition, it is important to set a background color as a fallback. Background
colors are supported pretty much everywhere, whereas more exotic features such
as background gradients are supported only in newer browsers, plus a background
image might fail to load for some reason. It is therefore a good idea to set a
basic background color as well as specifying such features, so the element's
content is readable no matter what.

<pre data-lang='html'>
{`
<p>Exciting box!</p>
`}
</pre>

<pre data-lang='css'>
{`
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  padding: 20px;
  /* background properties */
  background-color: yellow;
}
`}
</pre>

</CodePen>

### Background image

<CodePen>

The background-image property specifies a background image to display in the
background of an element. The simplest usage of this property involves using the
url() function — which takes the path to an image as a parameter — to fetch a
static image file to insert. Let's add a background image to the above example:

Yuck, this doesn't look great at the moment — the images are repeated
horizontally and vertically by default. We can fix this using background-repeat,
which we'll look at next.

> _IMPORTANT_ - One important thing to bear in mind is that since background
> images are set using CSS and appear in the background of content, they will be
> invisible to assistive technologies like screen readers. They are not content
> images — they are just for decoration — if you want to include an image on
> your page that is part of the content, then you should do so with an `<img>`
> element.

> _IMPORTANT_ - Use `<img>` for images that are meaningful for the content and
> `CSS` for images that are decorative.

<pre data-lang='html'>
{`
<p>Exciting box!</p>
`}
</pre>

<pre data-lang='css'>
{`
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  padding: 20px;
  /* background properties */
  background-color: yellow;
  background-image: url(https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13026/fire-ball-icon.png);
}
`}
</pre>

</CodePen>

### Background repeat

<CodePen>

background-repeat allows you to specify how the background image is repeated.
The default value is repeat which, as you saw above, makes the image keep
repeating until the whole element background is filled. This isn't what we want
in this case (although it might be in some cases, e.g.
repeating-background.html). Other common and widely supported values are:

| value       | description                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `no-repeat` | The image will not repeat at all: it will only be shown once.         |
| `repeat-x`  | The image will repeat horizontally all the way across the background. |
| `repeat-y`  | The image will repeat vertically all the way down the background.     |
| `repeat`    | The image will repeat both vertically and horizontally.               |

Let's fix our example.

This is certainly looking better, but the positioning of the image is off — it
is currently overlapping the text. We need to position it in a better place.

<pre data-lang='html'>
{`
<p>Exciting box!</p>
`}
</pre>

<pre data-lang='css'>
{`
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  padding: 20px;
  /* background properties */
  background-color: yellow;
  background-image: url(https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13026/fire-ball-icon.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
`}
</pre>

</CodePen>

### Background position

<CodePen>

background-position allows you to position your background image wherever you
want inside the background. Generally the property will take two values
separated by a space, which specify the horizontal (`x`) and vertical (`y`)
coordinates of the image. The top left corner of the image is the origin —
`(0,0)`. Think of the background as a graph, with the `x` coordinate going
across from left to right, and the `y` coordinate going from top to bottom.

The property can accept many different value types; the most common ones you'll
use are:

|                             |                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Absolute values like pixels | `background-position: 200px 25px`    |
| Relative values like rems   | `background-position: 20rem 2.5rem`  |
| Percentages                 | `background-position: 90% 25%`       |
| Keywords                    | `background-position: right center`. |

We can mix and match these values, for example
`background-position: 99% center`. Also note that if you only specify one value,
that value will be assumed to be the horizontal value, and the vertical value
will default to center.

Let's fix up our example.

<pre data-lang='html'>
{`
<p>Exciting box!</p>
`}
</pre>

<pre data-lang='css'>
{`
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  padding: 20px;
  /* background properties */
  background-color: yellow;
  background-image: url(https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13026/fire-ball-icon.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 99% center;
}
`}
</pre>

</CodePen>

### Background attachment

Another option we have available for backgrounds is specifying how they scroll
when the content scrolls. This is controlled using the `background-attachment`
property, which can take the following values:

|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scroll` | Causes the element's background to scroll when the page is scrolled. If the element content is scrolled, the background does not move. In effect, the background is fixed to the same position on the page, so it scrolls as the page scrolls.                                                                                                           |
| `fixed`  | Causes an element's background to be fixed to the viewport, so that it doesn't scroll when the page or element content is scrolled. It will always remain in the same position on the screen.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `local`  | This value was added later on (it is only supported in Internet Explorer 9+, whereas the others are supported in IE4+) because the scroll value is rather confusing and doesn't really do what you want in many cases. The local value fixes the background to the element it is set on, so when you scroll the element, the background scrolls with it. |

The background-attachment property only has an effect when there is content to
scroll, so we've made a demo to demonstrate the differences between the three
values — have a look at background-attachment.html (also see the source code
here).

See this
[demonstration](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/styling-boxes/backgrounds/background-attachment.html)
to see how these scroll effects work.

### Multiple backgrounds

Fairly recently (since Internet Explorer 9) we've had the ability to attach
multiple backgrounds to a single element. This is a good thing, as multiple
backgrounds are very useful. You separate your different background definitions
with commas:

```css
p {
  background: url(image.png) no-repeat 99% center, url(background-tile.png), linear-gradient(
      to bottom,
      yellow,
      #dddd00 50%,
      orange
    );
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

And the backgrounds are stacked on top of one another with the first appearing
at the top, then the second below it, then the third, etc. This is possibly not
what you were expecting, so take care. Also note that we've put the fallback
background color into a separate property declaration, because trying to include
it in the multiple backgrounds seems to break things.

You can also put multiple values into longhand background-\* properties, for
example:

```css
p {
  background-image: url(image.png), url(background-tile.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat;
}
```

Although you are probably better off using background shorthand — not only is it
quicker to write, but it is easier to see which background properties apply to
which background.

<CodePen>

Let's put multiple backgrounds onto our exciting box example — we want to see
the gradient and the fireball, both at the same time.

<pre data-lang='html'>
{`
<p>Exciting Box!</p>
`}
</pre>

<pre data-lang='css'>
{`
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  padding: 20px;
  /* background properties */
  background-color: yellow;
  background: url(https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13026/fire-ball-icon.png)
      no-repeat 99% center, linear-gradient(
      to bottom,
      yellow,
      #dddd00 50%,
      orange
    );
}
`}
</pre>

</CodePen>

### Background size

As we mentioned earlier, there is a property available — background-size — which
allows you to dynamically alter the size of a background image so that it fits
better into your design. This is very useful in many ways, for example
automatically correcting the size of icons that aren't uploaded correctly. Just
bear in mind that this isn't supported by Internet Explorer versions lower than
9, so you can't rely on it if you need to support older browsers. For each
background-image, you need to include two background size values — one for the
horizontal dimension, and one for the vertical:

```css
p {
  background-image: url(myimage.png);
  background-size: 16px 16px;
}
```

You can use all the length units you'd expect, to be able to specify the values
you want — `px`, `percentages`, `rems`, etc.
