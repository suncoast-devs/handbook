title: The Box Model
order: 12

Every element within a document is structured as a rectangular box inside the
document layout, the size and "onion layers", of which can be tweaked using some
specific CSS properties. The relevant properties are as follows:

- Padding refers to the inner zone of a CSS box — between the outer edge of the
  content box and the inner edge of the border. The size of this layer can be
  set on all four sides at once with the `padding` shorthand property, or one
  side at a time with the `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and
  `padding-left` properties.

- Border sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the
  margin. By default, the border has a size of `0` — making it invisible — but
  you can set the thickness, style, and color of the border to make it appear.
  The border shorthand property allows you to set all of these on all four sides
  at once, for example, `border: 1px solid black`. This can be broken down into
  numerous different longhand properties for more specific styling needs.

- Margin pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout. It behaves like
  `padding`; the shorthand property is `margin`, and the individual properties
  are `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left`.

## Advanced box manipulation

When you set the size of a box with absolute values (e.g. a fixed pixel
width/height), the content may not fit within the allowed size, in which case
the content overflows the box. To control what happens in such cases, we can use
the overflow property. It takes several possible values, but the most common
are:

|           |                                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto`    | If there is too much content, the overflowing content is hidden and scroll bars are shown to let the user scroll to see all the content. |
| `hidden`  | If there is too much content, the overflowing content is hidden.                                                                         |
| `visible` | If there is too much content, the overflowing content is shown outside of the box (this is usually the default behavior.)                |

## Types of CSS boxes

Everything we've said so far applies to boxes that represent block level
elements. However, CSS has other types of boxes that behave differently. The
type of box applied to an element is specified by the display property. There
are many different values available for display, we will focus on the three most
common ones; block, inline, and inline-block.

- A `block` box is defined as a box that's stacked upon other boxes (i.e.
  content before and after the box appears on a separate line) and can have
  width and height set on it. The whole box model as described above applies to
  block boxes.
- An `inline` box is the opposite of a `block` box: it flows with the document's
  text (i.e. it will appear on the same line as surrounding text and other
  inline elements, and its content will break with the flow of the text, like
  lines of text in a paragraph.) Width and height settings do not affect inline
  boxes; any padding, margin, and border set on inline boxes will update the
  position of surrounding text but will not affect the position of surrounding
  block boxes.
- An `inline-block` box is something in between the first two: It flows with
  surrounding text and other inline elements without creating line breaks before
  and after it unlike, a block box, but it can be sized using width and height
  and maintains its block integrity like a block box. It won't be broken across
  paragraph lines like an inline box. In the below example, the inline-block box
  goes onto the 2nd line of text while keeping the shape of a box as there is
  not enough space for it on the first line, whereas inline box does break on
  multiple lines if there is not enough space — it loses the shape of a box.
