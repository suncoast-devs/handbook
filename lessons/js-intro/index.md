## TypeScript

TypeScript is a language used to make web pages interactive, such as having
complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc. There are also more
advanced server-side versions of TypeScript, which allow you to add more
functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as real-time
collaboration between multiple computers).

In this lesson, we will discuss client (browser) side TypeScript.

Client-side TypeScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control
a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side
extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to
user events, such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. This means
that in the browser, TypeScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks.

## Document Object Model

We can use the power of TypeScript to make our web pages dynamic and powerful.
TypeScript interacts with our webpage through what is called the Document Object
Model (DOM).

The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming
languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML
representing a web page—in memory. Usually, that means TypeScript, although
modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects are not part of the JavaScript
language.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends
in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access
to the tree; with them, you can change the document's structure, style, or
content. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them; once an event is
triggered, the event handlers get executed.
