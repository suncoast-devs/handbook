# Learning Objectives

- What is JavaScript?
- How does JavaScript fit in the web?
- What is a line of code?
- Basic JavaScript operations.
- Basic JavaScript types (strings and numbers).
- What are variables and how to use them.
- What is a function?
- What is the DOM?
- How to listen to events?

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a language used to make webpages interactive (e.g. having complex
animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
server side versions of JavaScript such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) which
allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files
(such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers).

In this lesson we will discuss client (browser) side JavaScript.

Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control
a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side
extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to
user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. This means
that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks.

JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Both
"Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the
U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages are
significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and uses. Remember, "Java"
is to "JavaScript" like "car" is to "carpet".

## Document Object Model

We can use the power of JavaScript to make our webpages dynamic and powerful.
JavaScript interacts with our webpage through what is called the Document Object
Model (DOM).

The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming
languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML
representing a web page—in memory. Usually that means JavaScript, although
modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects is not part of the JavaScript
language, as such.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends
in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access
to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style, or
content. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them; once an event is
triggered, the event handlers get executed.
