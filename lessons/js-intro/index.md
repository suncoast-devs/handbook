## TypeScript

TypeScript is a language used to make webpages interactive (e.g. having complex
animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
server side versions of TypeScript which allow you to add more functionality to
a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between
multiple computers).

In this lesson we will discuss client (browser) side TypeScript.

Client-side TypeScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control
a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side
extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to
user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. This means
that in the browser, TypeScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks.

## Document Object Model

We can use the power of TypeScript to make our webpages dynamic and powerful.
TypeScript interacts with our webpage through what is called the Document Object
Model (DOM).

The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming
languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML
representing a web page—in memory. Usually that means TypeScript, although
modelling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects is not part of the TypeScript
language, as such.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends
in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access
to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style, or
content. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them; once an event is
triggered, the event handlers get executed.
