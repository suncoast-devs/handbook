# Stars

Let's update both the `SingleRestaurantFromList.tsx` and `Restaurant.tsx` to
show the correct average review stars for a restaurant.

## `Restaurant.tsx`

Before the `return` that renders the component, we will compute the average
ranking of stars. We begin by using `reduce` to total up the number of stars.
Then we divide by the number of reviews before creating a variable that is the
number of stars but with only one decimal place.

```javascript
const totalStars = restaurant.reviews.reduce(
  (starRatingSum, review) => starRatingSum + review.stars,
  0
)

const averageStars = totalStars / restaurant.reviews.length

const averageStarsToOneDecimalPlace = Number(averageStars.toFixed(1))
```

Then we update the display of stars:

```jsx
<span
  className="stars"
  style={{ '--rating': averageStarsToOneDecimalPlace }}
  aria-label={`Star rating of this location is ${averageStarsToOneDecimalPlace} out of 5.`}
></span>
```

However, if we visit a restaurant without any reviews, we will notice that we
don't see any stars! We don't see this because `restaurant.reviews.length` is
`0`, and thus `averageStars` becomes `NaN`.

We can solve this one of two ways.

The first is to realize that `NaN` is a _false-like_ value, and thus we can
rewrite the line as:

```javascript
const averageStars = totalStars / restaurant.reviews.length || 0
```

The second way is to use a `ternary` operator:

```javascript
const averageStars =
  restaurant.reviews.length === 0 ? 0 : totalStars / restaurant.reviews.length
```

In this style, we compare the length of the review array, and if it is zero, we
set the `averageStars` to `0`, otherwise setting it equal to the average.

We can do this same change in `SingleRestaurantFromList.tsx`.

```javascript
const totalStars = restaurant.reviews.reduce(
  (starRatingSum, review) => starRatingSum + review.stars,
  0
)

const averageStars =
  restaurant.reviews.length === 0 ? 0 : totalStars / restaurant.reviews.length

const averageStarsToOneDecimalPlace = Number(averageStars.toFixed(1))
```

# Extracting a component for reuse

We can now consider _extracting a component_ for the stars!

The first thing we'll do is create the component in the `Restaurants.tsx` code.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { CSSStarsProperties, RestaurantType } from '../types'

export function Stars({ restaurant }: { restaurant: RestaurantType }) {
  const totalStars = restaurant.reviews.reduce(
    (starRatingSum, review) => starRatingSum + review.stars,
    0
  )

  const averageStars =
    restaurant.reviews.length === 0 ? 0 : totalStars / restaurant.reviews.length

  const averageStarsToOneDecimalPlace = Number(averageStars.toFixed(1))

  return (
    <span
      className="stars"
      style={
        { '--rating': averageStarsToOneDecimalPlace } as CSSStarsProperties
      }
      aria-label={`Star rating of this location is ${averageStarsToOneDecimalPlace} out of 5.`}
    ></span>
  )
}

```

Then we can use this in place of the `<span>` for stars and get rid of the
computation of the variables.

```jsx
<p>
  <Stars restaurant={restaurant} />({restaurant.reviews.length})
</p>
```

Now we can do a similar refactoring in the `Restaurant.tsx` file. First, remove
the computation variables and then replace the `<span>` used for showing the
stars, importing the `stars` component.

```jsx
<Stars restaurant={restaurant} />
```

And now we have a reusable component showing the correct number of stars for any
restaurant.
