title: Code Folder
---

During this course we are going to be creating many projects. Each of these will
have their own directory. Thus we should attempt to organize these in some
manner.

## Choosing a place to keep your projects.

We feel there are a few choices on where to keep your projects

1. In a folder named `sdg` or `code` or `projects` in your _home directory_.
   Your _home directory_ is where your PowerShell or terminal will start from.
   This makes your code directory just a step away.
2. In a folder named `sdg` or `code` or `projects` in your `Documents`
   directory. This is one directory below your _home folder_ so it is still
   nearby.
3. In a folder named `sdg` or `code` or `projects` on your `Desktop`. This too
   is only one directory below your _home folder_ so it is still nearby.

Skip to the section below matching your desired structure.

## Creating a folder in your home directory.

Choose what you want to call this directory and use the following commands to
create it.

Choose what you want to call this directory and use the following commands to
create it.
