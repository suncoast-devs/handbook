# Play Robot

In this activity, we will explore the necessity to be specific and detailed in
how we present information to a computer.

## Numbers...

Form either pairs, triplets, or groups of four for this activity. Each person in
the group should take turns _playing_ the role of the algorithm tester while the
others act as the algorithm authors.

### Number Challenge: Adding

- Adding/finding/ordering numbers

  - Add any two numbers (not necessarily numbers in order)
  - Add any ten numbers (not necessarily numbers in order)
  - Add one hundred numbers (not necessarily numbers in order)

### Number Challenge: Searching

- Find the lower of two numbers (not necessarily numbers in order)
- Find the lowest of ten numbers (not necessarily numbers in order)
- Find the lowest of one hundred numbers (not necessarily numbers in order)

## Number Challenge: Ordering

- Put two numbers in order
- Put ten numbers in order
- Put one hundred numbers in order

## Scrabble Tiles

In the following problems, you are allowed to use the following sentences as
your _language_

We will have "memory spots" in this exercise. The best way to represent this is
to get out a sheet of paper and make several squares to label each one. These
squares will either contain a number or a tile.

```
Make a memory spot with the label ____.

Turn over the scrabble tile at position ____, copy the tile to a memory spot labeled ____, turn the tile back over.

Put the number ____ in the memory spot labeled ____.

Add `1` to the value of the number at the memory spot labeled ____.

If the tile in memory spot with the label ____ is equal to ____ then do the next step, otherwise, skip the next step.

STOP with the answer YES

STOP with the answer NO
```

### Scrabble Tile Challenge

Take ten scrabble tiles from your set and write algorithms for the following:

- Do you have a Z in your tiles?
- Can you make the word `SDG`?
- Do you have any vowels?

Try your algorithm for the entire bag of scrabble tiles you have. Does it still
work? What part is slow, if any?
