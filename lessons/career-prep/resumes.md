So you are ready to start jumping into the job search. The first stop on your
journey to your next job is your resume. So what information do you need to have
on your resume?

# Resume Must-Haves

## Contact information

Giving employers and recruiters a method for contacting you is vital. You want
to make sure you give more than one outreach method and links where they can see
your work.

### Your Name

Use your full professional name; this is the name that your application is filed
under and used when verifying information about you.

If you have a preferred name, it is recommended you still use your full name,
but it ok to add your preferred name in parentheses if you choose —for example,
Kathlyn (Kathy) Harrison.

### Email

Having a professional email address is vital. You want to keep in mind that an
employer may use this email to schedule an interview, send over an offer for
employment, and any paperwork you need to complete. Here are some dos and don'ts
of email:

Do:

- Use a professional email address
- Use your first initial, last name, or full name if possible.
- Create a custom domain if you want to match your email address to your
  portfolio

Don't:

- Use an email address such as "soccerdude98@hotmail.com", while it is personal
  to you, it doesn't appear professional. It also doesn't let your recipient
  know who is sending it, and it could end up in a spam folder.

Here are some examples of professional email addresses.

- First name only: kathlyn@email.com
- First name and last name, without punctuation: kathlynharrison@email.com
- First name and last name, with punctuation: kathlyn.harrison@email.com
- First name, last name, and middle initial, with punctuation:
  kathlyn.s.harrison@email.com
- First initial and last name: kharrison@email.com
- First and middle initial and last name: kmjohnson@email.com
- Custom Domain: kathlyn@harrisondev.io

**_Note_**: It is important to remember that _Dots_ don't matter in Gmail
addresses

### Phone Number

Having your phone number on your resume is essential to help employers reach you
quickly. Employers having access to your phone number means that you should
maintain a professional voicemail recording and keep your voicemail available
for messages. You don't want a "full mailbox" to stop you from getting your
dream job.

When it comes to listing your phone number on your resume, several different
formats are considered acceptable: 727-867-5309 | (727) 867-5309 | 727.867.5309

You can also choose to put a label in front of your phone number such as "Tel:",
"Ph:", "Phone:", or "M:" (for mobile).

**_Note:_** Google numbers are easy to create and useful if you want to protect
your number

### Github Link

Adding your GitHub link to your contact information not only shows you know how
to use GitHub, but it also gives employers and interviewers quick access to
examples of your work. Listing it as _github.com/username_ and making it a
clickable link is acceptable and understood by other developers.

### Portfolio link

Similar to having your GitHub link on your resume, having a link to your
portfolio gives employers, and interviewers access to your work. If your
portfolio URL is too long for the space available, it is ok to use a
[Bit.ly link](https://bitly.com/) for a better visual flow.

## Career Summary

This section should be a brief paragraph (three to five sentences) that shows
the value you bring by highlighting your skills and a couple of big career wins.

Here are some things to think about when writing your Career Summary:

- Grab a hiring manager's attention right from the beginning, remembering you
  have only 25 seconds to make a good impression.
- Spend time developing a summary that immediately gets their attention, and
  accurately and powerfully describes you as a solution to their problems.

## Skills

Listing your skills on your resume incorporates the right keywords to optimize
your resume for applicant tracking systems.

Think of your skills as three possible categories:

- Technical skills section
- Relevant skills section
- Additional skills section

Listing your skills, especially when changing careers, can help boost your
resume and showcase your ability to work in languages a position requires. You
don't have to list every minute skill you may have. Stick to skills that benefit
the position or organization.

## Projects

It's essential to list your most relevant projects on your resume to communicate
your experience and skills, but also to highlight hands-on examples of how you
applied your capabilities to find a solution.

You can use your homework assignments or capstone project for this section if
you are in the program or a recent graduate.

Need an example of listing a project:

**Project Name** | GitHub Link

- Skills Used: HTML, CSS, React, .Net
- Brief Description of the project (two-three lines)

## Professional experience

When starting to list your Professional Experience, you should list your most
recent job experience first, then the job before that, and so on. There are some
exceptions to this rule, but most employers are expecting your resume to follow
this format.

So what information should you include?

- Name of the employer
- Your job title
- Years of employment
- List three to four bullet points describing your most impressive achievements
  in that position. Focus on your accomplishments rather than your day-to-day
  responsibilities.

**_Note:_** The projects that you complete as a student at SDG can be listed as
experience if you choose not to have a separate Projects section.

- [Should you use a chronological or functional resume?](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/chronological-resume-or-functional-resume)

## Education

If you have a limited educational background, don't panic. Lucky for you in the
development community, many organizations and teams need skill and a good fit
over someone with a specific degree.

If you have a degree or other educational background, please include it, even if
it is not related to what you are doing now.

So what information should you include:

- Name of the school
- Location of the school
- Degree or Certificate obtained (if applicable)
- Field of study
- Graduation year (if applicable)
- GPA (Note: You may not want to include this if it's not above 3.4)
- Relevant honors or academic recognition, coursework, activities or other
  achievements obtained during your education

## Bonus - Volunteering

Listing volunteering and community service programs that you are involved in can
help employers know what passions you have outside of work. Adding your
volunteering is not mandatory, so if you are running out of space, leave it off
but be sure to talk about them during each interview.

## Resume Length: One-page vs. Two page

So you have written your resume, formatted it to your liking, and now realize
that it takes up multiple pages. The length of your resume depends on the amount
of information you need to share.

> "In a survey of employers, 66% said an entry-level resume should be one page
> Meanwhile, 77% said seasoned workers should have at least a 2-page resume, and
> maybe longer. Shockingly, 39% of experienced workers say their resumes are
> only one page long." - [zety.com](https://zety.com/blog/two-page-resume)

### One page

One page resumes are easier to read, which is why so many people think resumes
should be limited to one page. When you think about it, resume readers have to
look at a large number of resumes daily, so having less information to scan
makes sense. So how do you know if a one-page resume is right for you?

- Are you an entry-level worker?
- Are you a recent graduate?
- Are you making a career change?
- Do you only have a few years of work experience?
- If you answered yes to any of these questions, a one-page resume would work
  for you.

### Two pages

What should you do if your level of experience requires you to have more than
one page for your resume? First, start by taking a close look at the experience
you are listing. If you are going back to positions and experience that can be
supported better by newer experience, it is ok to start eliminating unneeded
positions. A general rule of thumb is that the applicant should be able to fit
10 years of work experience onto each page of their resume.

Something to keep in mind: the second page of your resume may not get as much
attention as the first page, and it can even be separated if someone prints them
out. You want to make sure that the first page contains your most vital
information to make an impact on the reader.
