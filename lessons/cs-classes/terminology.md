| State              | The information that we need to keep track of in our program.                                                                                      |
| Behavior           | The code that interacts with the information (state) in our program.                                                                               |
| Class              | A class defines the kinds of data and the functionality their objects will have.                                                                   |
| Object             | Instance of a class that is created dynamically.                                                                                                   |
| Get                | Retrieve the information stored within that property of our class.                                                                                 |
| Set                | Change the information in that property of our class.                                                                                              |
| Constructor        | A special method of the class which gets automatically invoked whenever an instance of the class is created.                                       |
| Properties         | An attribute of the class in our program.                                                                                                          |
| Public Property    | This property can be seen outside of the class.                                                                                                    |
| Protected Property | This property can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class.                                       |
| Private Property   | This property can only be seen from other code within the class itself.                                                                            |
| Encapsulation      | Enables a group of properties, methods and other members to be considered a single unit or object.                                                 |
| Inheritance        | The ability to create a class that inherits attributes and behaviors from an existing class. hese are in an _is a_ or _is a kind of_ relationship. |
