# Prettier

Developing a clean writing style is just as important when writing code as it is when writing prose. To help us with developing this style, we can use an automatic code formatter. This will ensure that our code is formatted with the proper indentation and the correct placement of syntax.

We will be using the `prettier` formatter for our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --global prettier
```
