title: Windows Terminal
---

Windows Terminal is a better tool for running PowerShell. It uses a better color
scheme for text and errors. It also supports multiple tabbed windows. We
recommend this in place of running PowerShell directly.

If you do choose to use Windows Terminal, any place that says to start a
PowerShell you may start a new Windows Terminal tab.

## Installation

```sh
scoop install windows-terminal
```
