# Slack

Slack will be our main form of communication. You will communicate with your instructors and SDG staff via Slack. You will get notifications of homework, links to resources, and be able to ask for help via Slack.

Download it to you computer; if you have a smart phone, I _highly_ recommend installing the app.

## Installation

Open your browser and [download the desktop client](https://slack.com/downloads) for your platform.

Open your phone's application store and install the mobile application and sign in at least once.

## Setup

You should have received an invitation to several Slack _Teams_

SDG maintains two main Slack Teams:

- `sdg-sa` is for students and alumni _only_
- `suncoast-devs` is a general Tampa Bay community team that includes over 1,300 members.
