# Algorithms: Day Three

# Real world examples: Transforming data, codes and ciphers

---

# These examples will use:

- Looping
- Transforming
- Conditionals

---

# First Example: Substitution Cipher

- Transforms one input into another
- Attempts to make it difficult to decode the "ciphertext" back into "plaintext"

---

# Simple substitution

- Consider only the uppercase letters A through Z
- For each letter we have another unique letter to transform into

# What is our algorithm?

[.autoscale: true]
[.build-lists: true]

1. Start at the first letter of our plaintext
1. If the letter is "S" put a "Z" in the ciphertext
1. If the letter is "D" put a "D" in the ciphertext
1. If the letter is "G" put a "R" in the ciphertext
1. If the letter is "L" put a "T" in the ciphertext
1. ...
1. If the letter is "X" put a "I" in the ciphertext
1. If the letter is "Y" put a "M" in the ciphertext
1. If the letter is "Z" put a "J" in the ciphertext
1. If that was the last letter in the plaintext: STOP
1. Go to the next letter of our plaintext
1. Go back to step 2

# We'll learn more efficient ways of doing things other than a bunch of "if"s

---

# What do you think the algorithm is for decoding?

---

# Caesar cipher

---

# This is a "shift" cipher

Takes each letter and "shifts" it down the alphabet, circling back to the start if we go off the end.

---

# A .. Z, with a shift number

Let's take the example of a shift of 3.

# Encoding the phrase CODES

Works just like when using a substitution cipher.

What is the ciphertext?

---

# Is there another way?

Can we use the position information?

What if there was a shift of 0?

```
1. Start with the first letter in the plain text
2. For the given letter, figure out it's index in the alphabet (e.g. A is 0, B is 1, ..., Y is 24, Z is 25)
3. Go to that index in the shifted alphabet and copy that letter to the ciphertext
4. If this is the last letter in the plain text: STOP
5. Consider the next letter in the plain text
6. Go to step 2
```

---

# What if the shift was more than 0?

How do we handle the "index in the shifted alphabet"?

First attempt, consider a shift of 3

```
1. Start with the first letter in the plain text
2. For the given letter, figure out it's index in the alphabet (e.g. A is 0, B is 1, ..., Y is 24, Z is 25)
3. Add 3 to that index
4. If the index is more than 25 (the index of Z), subtract 25
5. Go to that index in the alphabet and copy that letter to the ciphertext
6. If this is the last letter in the plain text: STOP
7. Consider the next letter in the plain text
8. Go to step 2
```

Only needs _ONE_ alphabet!
No need to keep that second alphabet order.

# [fit] Another way to deal with "... went off the end of the alphabet"

<br/>

# [fit] Modulus

---

# [fit] Division

Consider integer division.

`19 divided by 8` is `2 with a remainder of 3`

or

`19 / 3` is `2 with a remainder of 3`

---

# [fit] That remainder is considered the "modulus"

We would say:

`19 modulus 8` is `3`

The symbol used in most programming languages is the `%`

`19 % 8` is `3`

---

# [fit] How does this help us?

---

[.column]

Consider the index divided by 26, but only the remainder.

[.column]

```
 0 % 26 = 0
 1 % 26 = 1
 2 % 26 = 2
 3 % 26 = 3
 4 % 26 = 4
 5 % 26 = 5
 6 % 26 = 6
 7 % 26 = 7
 8 % 26 = 8
 9 % 26 = 9
10 % 26 = 10
11 % 26 = 11
12 % 26 = 12
13 % 26 = 13
14 % 26 = 14
15 % 26 = 15
16 % 26 = 16
17 % 26 = 17
18 % 26 = 18
19 % 26 = 19
20 % 26 = 20
21 % 26 = 21
22 % 26 = 22
23 % 26 = 23
24 % 26 = 24
25 % 26 = 25
```

---

[.column]

... and when we run off the end ...

[.column]

```
20 % 26 = 20
21 % 26 = 21
22 % 26 = 22
23 % 26 = 23
24 % 26 = 24
25 % 26 = 25
26 % 26 = 0   <== Aha, we "wrap" around
27 % 26 = 1
28 % 26 = 2
29 % 26 = 3
30 % 26 = 4
31 % 26 = 5
32 % 26 = 6
33 % 26 = 7
34 % 26 = 8
35 % 26 = 9
```

---

# So another way to write our algorithm

---

```
1. Start with the first letter in the plain text
2. For the given letter, figure out it's index in the alphabet
   (e.g. A is 0, B is 1, ..., Y is 24, Z is 25)
3. Go to the index in the alphabet given by the formula

   (current letter index + offset) % shift number

   and copy that letter to the ciphertext
4. If this is the last letter in the plain text: STOP
5. Consider the next letter in the plain text
6. Go to step 2
```

- One alphabet
- Works for any shift number

---

# How would you work with _DECODING_ ?

---

[.autoscale: true]

# Example: ROT13

- Simple Caeser Cipher with offset 13 (half the alphabet)
- No need to use a _negative_ code to decipher (since `26 - 13` is `13`)
- Try [here](https://rot13.com/)
- Used for a while on the early days of the internet to avoid spoilers. Everything was plaintext.
- Example: "Whow, I just saw Empire Strikes back! I can't believe `Qnegu Inqre vf Yhxr'f sngure!`
