# More Ciphers

## Musical Cipher

Consider the
[Solfa Cipher](https://www.wmich.edu/mus-theo/solfa-cipher/secrets/) that
encodes text into a musical notation. The bottom of the page has details on how
the encoding works.

- Do you think this makes the cipher more challenging to decode? Why, or why
  not?

## Other Ciphers

Consider the ciphers at [this site](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/) and choose
a few to investigate.

- What aspect of the encoding algorithm do you think makes any of these ciphers
  stronger than the ones we've considered so far?

- Choose one cipher and see if you can write an algorithm for it.
