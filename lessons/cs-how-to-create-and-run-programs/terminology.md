| Directory                                | The path that computers use to organize files and folders. For example, when creating a folder on your desktop named "SDG", you are making a directory called "SDG" that lives on your desktop.            |
| Command                                  | A task set for the computer to do in the console. As long as there is not a task running, the console is always looking for a command from the user.                                                       |
