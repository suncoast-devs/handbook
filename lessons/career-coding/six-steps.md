[Madison Kanna](https://twitter.com/Madisonkanna) started a great
[thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Madisonkanna/status/1279158985518485504).
Check out her suggestions and some resources I pulled from it in the thread:

> me go from watching tutorials to actually building projects.

1. Add new features to your tutorial apps. Take the app you've built in your
   tutorial and come up with one small feature you can add to that app. Then
   build it on your own. You'll start building, but in a way that is doable and
   not so overwhelming that you give up.

2. Build with a friend or group. When you start a project alone, it's easy to
   give up when you feel lost and unsure of what to do next. With a friend or
   group, you can figure it out & help each other get unstuck We're working on
   creating groups to do this in the
   [@codebookclub](https://twitter.com/CodeBookClub)

3. Build small projects first, then bigger ones later. Start off by building a
   small idea. Your MVP. Then continue to add little features to your project.
   It might seem small or boring to build so small, but this is how big projects
   are created: one small step at a time.

4. Read and understand someone else's project, then try to rebuild it. Read
   through a project you love. Write down how the app is working. Then try to
   create it. Refer back to it if needed. You'll have a basic template to get
   going with.

5. Use [@codepen](https://twitter.com/CodePen) or
   [@codesandbox](https://twitter.com/codesandbox) to start off. Starting your
   own project can be overwhelming because of so many tasks you have to do to
   even get it live. Using one of the both is a good way to quickly get your
   project up and running and sharable.

6. Starting a coding project can be like standing at the foot of a mountain,
   paralyzed as you look up at how far you have to go to reach the summit. You
   give up before you start. So don't focus on the summit, focus on your next
   step. The next small bit of code.
