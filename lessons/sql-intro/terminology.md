| Structured Query Language                                                         | A descriptive computer language designed for updating, retrieving, and calculating data in table-based databases.                                                                                                                           |
| Database                                                                          | A structured way to store lots of information.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Serialization                                                                     | Take the information we have stored in memory and represent it as a series of characters/bytes that can be stored in a file.                                                                                                                |

Either all of them fail, or all of them succeed.                                                                                                                     |
| Consistency                                                                       | Any rules the database enforces are applied when asking for changes.                                                                                                                                                                        |

This feature is what allows databases to be a great choice for multi-user systems.               |
| Durability                                                                        | Ensures that once data is written to the database, the database does not lose the information in the case of a database, computer, or system crash.                                                                                         |

| relationships and structure. This is often referred to as "Relational Databases". |
| NoSQL                                                                             | Can be thought of as the opposite of SQL. At a high level, a NoSQL database stores data in a form other than the table structure.This looseness of data structure allows developers to more freely control what and how the data is stored. |
| Schema                                                                            | The structure of a table that is represented by columns and constraints.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| char(N)                                                                           | The `N` represents the largest number of characters this column can store. If we supply _less_ than `N` characters the rest of the column will be padded with spaces. This ensures the column is _always_ `N` characters long.              |
| varchar(N)                                                                        | The `N` represents the largest number of characters the column can store, however, the width of the data is variable. If we supply _less_ than `N` characters the column is _not_ filled with spaces.                                       |
| text                                                                              | Allows for a variable number of characters, but has a much larger limit than what a `char` or `varchar` can support. In some cases many megabytes, or gigabytes of text.                                                                    |
