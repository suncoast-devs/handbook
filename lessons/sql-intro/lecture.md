# [fit] SQL

---

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a descriptive computer language designed for updating, retrieving, and calculating data in table-based databases.

> Mozilla Developer Network

---

# [fit] Been around since the early 70s.

---

# Has features we've been looking for

- Structured
- Random Access (don't have to rewrite or append)
- Can store multiple related data in one place
- Supports multiple users

---

# Has other features: ACID

- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability

---

# [fit] Atomicity

Updates to the database allow for multiple changes to execute at once. Either all of them fail, or all of them succeed.

^ For instance, if our application is a banking application and we want to
withdraw $10 from Andy's account and add it to Barbara's account, we might
first write a statement to decrease Andy's balance by 10. Then a second
statement to increase Barbara's balance by 10. If these two statements aren't
guaranteed to succeed in pairs, we can decrease
Andy's balance without correspondingly increasing Barbara's. In an `atomic`
system, either we would both decrease Andy's balance and increase Barbara's
balance - _or_ - if an error occurs, their balances are as they were at the
start.

---

# [fit] Consistency

Any rules the database enforces are applied when asking for changes.

^ An example is when creating a user in a system, we _require_ the user to have
an email address and a password. If we attempt to create a row in the `Users`
table, but the `Email` field is blank, we do not allow the row. The validation upholds our expectations of the contents of the database.

---

# [fit] Isolation

Isolation allows for multiple database requests to be handled concurrently (e.g., reading and writing to multiple tables/rows at the same time)

---

# [fit] Durability

Durability ensures that once data is written to the database, the database does not lose the information in the case of a database, computer, or system crash.

Once a database says that row updates, a power loss to the system should not lose the updated data.

---

# [fit] SQL Basics

- SQL (relational) databases store and arrange data into tables.
- These tables consist of rows where each row has the same set of columns.

> For an analogy, you can think of a database as an Excel spreadsheet, a table as "sheet" within that spreadsheet, rows as the rows of the sheet, and columns as _named_ versions of the familiar "Column A", "Column B" style of spreadsheets.

---

### Tables

- Tables are the containers for our data.
- Usually, a database has multiple tables, one for each "thing" we are storing.

---

For instance, let's imagine we are designing and building a system to manage books for a library. We could create a database named `Library` and in that database, there would be one table, called `Books`.

In this `Books` table, we would design columns representing the specific data about books we wish to track. Each row in the `Books` table would represent a unique book in our collection.

---

### Columns

- Columns are the part of the table that defines the structure (what we often call the `schema`).
- This is where we define the attributes of the "thing" represented by the table.
- Every column has a data type that defines and restricts what type of data we can place into each column.

---

- In our `Books` table, we will want to store specific details:
- `Title`
- `PrimaryAuthor`
- `YearPublished`
- `Genre`

In a language such as JavaScript, Ruby, or C# we would naturally define some of these as a `string`

In a database, we have a few choices for the data type.

---

`char(N)`

The `N` represents the largest number of characters this column can store. If we supply _less_ than `N` characters, spaces will fill the remaining space. The appended spaces ensures the column is _always_ `N` characters long

---

`varchar(N)`

Again the `N` represents the largest number of characters the column can store. However, the width of the data is variable. If we supply _less_ than `N` characters, the column is _not_ filled with spaces.

---

`text`

Allows for a variable number of characters but has a much larger limit than what a `char` or `varchar` can support. In some cases many megabytes, or gigabytes of text.

---

In our case, `varchar` or `text` make the most sense for our columns.

See the Postgres docs for more details.

---

### Rows

Rows are where our data is stored.

Each row represents one instance of a "thing", in our case one "book".

> Much like one `object` is an instance of a class (_this is an important concept_)

In our example, a row of data would contain 'The Cat in the Hat' (`Title`), 'Dr. Suess' (`Author`), and 'kids' (`Genre`).

## You may choose to follow along

<br/>

> All the commands are in the `Introduction to SQL` lesson, so feel free to copy + paste.

---

# Create our first database

First, we need to create a database:

```shell
createdb Library
```

<br/>

> We can run this command from any directory, it doesn't matter.

<br/>

> This creates a new, empty database.

---

# But where is it?

The databases, tables, columns, rows, relationships, and data are stored and managed by the database.

We do not see where it keeps the data or how the database structures the data.

Eventually, the data won't even be on the same computer where our code runs!

---

# Connecting

To connect to that database and start running queries against it, use the command:

```shell
pgcli Library
```

---

# [fit] REPL

- Read
- Evaluate
- Print
- Loop

> Like our command terminal/shell but now the commands go to the database instead of our operating system.

---

### Queries

SQL databases use the `S`tructured `Q`uery `L`anguage to both define the `schema` (structure) of our database and as a way to create, read, update, and delete data within it.

<br/>

We call the statements we ask a database to do for us a `query`, even if the statement's purpose is to create tables, or delete rows.

---

### CREATE TABLE

Let's start by creating the table with only the `Title`, `PrimaryAuthor`, and the `YearPublished` columns for our `Books`

```sql
CREATE TABLE "Books" (
  "Title"          TEXT NOT NULL,
  "PrimaryAuthor"  TEXT,
  "YearPublished"  INT,
  "Id"             SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
);
```

---

# [fit] Break it down

- `TEXT`
- `NOT NULL`
- `INT`
- `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`

---

# Other types

| Type      | Description                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BOOLEAN   | Stores a `true` or `false` value                                                                        |
| DATE      | Stores a year, month, and day together. Use `YYYY-MM-DD` format such as `'2020-07-04'` when adding data |
| TIMESTAMP | Stores a precise time, Use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:DD` format such as `'2020-07-04 15:45:12` when adding data |

---

### ALTER TABLE

The structure of our tables is not set in stone.

Can be modified at a later date by using the `ALTER TABLE` query.

```sql
ALTER TABLE "Books" ADD COLUMN "Genre" VARCHAR(15);
```

---

#### INSERT

To create a new row in our database, we need to use `INSERT`.

The format for `INSERT` statements is similar to:

> EXAMPLE ONLY

```sql
INSERT INTO "TableName" ("ColumnA", "ColumnB", "ColumnC")
VALUES ('columnAValue', 'columnBValue', 'columnCValue');
```

---

# [fit] Break it down

- Table Name
- List of columns
- List of values in the same order

---

# Sample data

```sql
INSERT INTO Books (Title,  PrimaryAuthor, YearPublished, Genre)
VALUES ('Night of the Living Dummy', 'R. L. Stine', 1993, 'horror');

INSERT INTO Books (Title,  PrimaryAuthor, YearPublished, Genre)
VALUES ('A Shocker on Shock Street', 'R. L. Stine', 1995, 'horror');

INSERT INTO Books (Title,  PrimaryAuthor, YearPublished, Genre)
VALUES ('The Lost World', 'Michael Crichton', 1995, 'sci-fi');
```

---

### SELECT

`SELECT` statements allow us to query and return a new view of the data.

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Books";
```

This query will give us back all the columns (`*`) from all the rows in the `Books` table.

Regardless if there are ten rows or ten million rows, this statement will return them all.

---

### SELECT (some of the columns)

Often we do not want _all_ the columns from the table. We can specify specific columns.

```sql
SELECT "Title", "PrimaryAuthor" FROM "Books";
```

While this will still return all the rows, we will only see the `Title` and `PrimaryAuthor` columns for all those rows.

---

# [fit] Wait. It gets better.

---

# We can also do computations with `SELECT`

See the number of books:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "Books";
```

See the average, largest, and smallest year of publication.

```sql
SELECT AVG("YearPublished"), MAX("YearPublished"), MIN("YearPublished")
FROM "Books";
```

---

# `SELECT` and `WHERE` together!

We can use the `WHERE` clause to help filter down our table to only see rows that satisfy the conditions supplied.

`SQL`

```sql
SELECT "Title", "PrimaryAuthor" FROM "Books" WHERE "Genre" = 'horror';
```

`C#`

```csharp
books.
   Where(book => book.Genre == "horror").
   Select(book => book.Title);
```

---

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Books";

SELECT "Title", "PrimaryAuthor" FROM "Books";
SELECT "Title", "PrimaryAuthor" FROM "Books" WHERE "Genre" = 'horror';
SELECT "Title", "PrimaryAuthor" FROM "Books" WHERE "Genre" = 'fantasy' OR "Genre" = 'sci-fi';
SELECT "Title", "PrimaryAuthor" FROM "Books" WHERE "Genre" = 'horror' ORDER BY "Title";
SELECT "Title", "PrimaryAuthor" FROM "Books" WHERE "Title" LIKE 'The Lord of the Rings%' ORDER BY "Title";
```

---

# Aliases using the "AS" keyword

Sometimes we want to use a different name for a column than the name in the table itself. SQL allows us to do this with the `AS` keyword.

We can use an alternate name for a column by using the `AS` keyword.

```sql
SELECT "Title" AS "BookTitle" FROM "Books";
```

We can also rename the table itself:

```sql
SELECT "Title" AS "BookTitle" FROM "Books" AS "BooksTable";
```

---

# UPDATE

To change data in our database, we use an `UPDATE` statement. The general structure of an `UPDATE` is:

```sql
UPDATE "TableName"
SET "ColumnA" = 'new value'
WHERE "ColumnB" = 'some value';
```

The above update statement will update all rows that have `ColumnB = 'some value'` and change `ColumnA` to contain `'new value'`.

---

# NOTE

The same syntax for `WHERE` clauses from `SELECT` apply here. We can use multiple conditions and combine them with `AND` and `OR`

> Word of warning. If the `WHERE` clause is left off, it will update all rows.

This might cause a **bad day**

---

Example:

```sql
UPDATE "Books" SET "Genre" = 'children horror' WHERE "PrimaryAuthor" = 'R. L. Stine';
```

---

# DELETE

To remove one **or many** rows, we can use the `DELETE` statement.

```sql
DELETE FROM "Books" WHERE "YearPublished" = 1995;
```

As with the `UPDATE` statement, the `DELETE` statement can use the same `WHERE` syntax to filter rows to delete.

> Word of warning. If the `WHERE` clause is left off, it will delete all rows.

This might cause a **bad day**
