| loops          | Perform a task repeatedly or a certain number of times, perform a task repeatedly until a condition is met or to process all of the items in a collection.                                                                                            |
| `while` loop   | When executing code that needs to continue running over and over until the condition in the while loop is true. For example: `while(reading) {Console.WriteLine("I'm being read")}` if reading becomes false there is nothing written to the console. |
| `for` loop     | Executes a block of statements repeatedly until the specified Condition returns false.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Initialization | Do this at the start of the `for` loop.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Condition      | Keep going as long as this is true during the `for` loop.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Afterthought   | Do this after each loop through the `for` loop is done.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `foreach` loop | Executes a block of code on each element in an array or a collection of items.                                                                                                                                                                        |
