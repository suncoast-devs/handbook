# Introduction to React

---

> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

---

It was developed by Facebook around 2011/2012 and was released as an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) project in 2013.

# Claims

- React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

- Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

- We donâ€™t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

---

# Components

- HTML and CSS focused on decomposing UI into blocks and groups of elements for content, semantics, and styling.

- The same is true for React Components.

- We can now also look at our pages as collections of React Components.

- Each of these components can be reused which will help us reduce code.

---

# Class versus Function components

- Two styles of React components

- `Class` components came first and most documentation, tutorials, and Stack Overflow answers are using `class`

- The other style, `functions/hooks` is the future.

---

# What does a Component look like

## The rules of a React component are:

- It must `extend React.Component`
- It must have a `render()` method that returns JSX
- The JSX that `render()` returns must consist of _exactly_ one main element, with other elements contained within. We'll see this more later.

---

# What is JSX?

JSX is an extension of JavaScript that allows us to use an HTML-like syntax in our JavaScript code that will be turned into DOM at run-time. By using JSX we can dynamically generate content and use a [UI as state](lessons/js-ui-as-state) style.

---

# Simplest React Component

```javascript
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello, World!</div>
  }
}
```

---

# HTML in our JS?!?

```javascript
return <div>Hello, World!</div>
```

---

# How does app-app help us use React Components?

- `app-app` for React is inspired by `create-react-app` which is the default tool for generating React projects.
- React Components can represent the **entire** web page, or be mixed in with static content of the page.
- `app-app` turns our whole page/app/site over to React

---

# Let's create a new app-app React project

```
app-app --gamma ReactArticles
```

---

# HTML file

The template SDG uses from `app-app` will generate an `index.html` file that looks like the following (only the `<body>` is shown and only the relevant parts)

```html
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
```

---

# Where is the User Interface!??

If we rendered this without JavaScript it would be an empty page. It is thus up to JavaScript to connect our React code to our HTML.

---

# User Interface all in JavaScript

In our SDG template from `app-app` we include an `index.js` -- this script loads React and a component we provide named `App`

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

---

# ReactDOM is the glue between HTML and JavaScript

React connects an existing `DOM` element to a component with the `ReactDOM` method. Here we state that the element with the `id` of `root` will be replaced with the component `App` that we `import` from the `App.jsx` file.

Typically we will not have to adjust the `index.html` or the `index.js` files. We will start writing our code in our `App.jsx` file.

---

# JSX Files and _transpiling_

You may have noticed that we define our React Components in files that end in `.jsx` instead of `.js`.

The `.jsx` extension allows our editors and our code management tools to know we are using the `JSX` extensions.

Browsers do not understand `JSX` by default so a [transpile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) step takes place automatically. This step turns our `JSX` into plain `JavaScript` that a browser **can** understand.

---

# Build a simple React application

This is some sample HTML we will work to create and learn how React Components can help simplify our code.

```html
<div class="all-main-content">
  <main>
    <article class="intro-article">
      <h2 className="article-title">SDG Announces Hackathon!</h2>
      <p>
        SDG announces the 2020 Summer Hackathon. Join us for an exciting weekend
      </p>
      <a class="read-more" href="#here">
        read more about SDG Announces Hackathon!
      </a>
    </article>

    <article class="intro-article">
      <h2 className="article-title">
        Student Graduation is Right Around the Corner
      </h2>
      <p>Our next cohort of students will be graduating in just over a week.</p>
      <a class="read-more" href="#here">
        read more about Student Graduation is Right Around the Corner
      </a>
    </article>
  </main>
</div>
```

# Start with `hard coded` content

We'll take our HTML and place it _ALL_ inside the `render` method of our `App`

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="all-main-content">
        <main>
          <article className="intro-article">
            <h2 className="article-title">SDG Announces Hackathon!</h2>
            <p>
              SDG announces the 2020 Summer Hackathon. Join us for an exciting
              weekend
            </p>
            <a className="read-more" href="#here">
              read more about SDG Announces Hackathon!
            </a>
          </article>

          <article className="intro-article">
            <h2 className="article-title">
              Student Graduation is Right Around the Corner
            </h2>
            <p>
              Our next cohort of students will be graduating in just over a
              week.
            </p>
            <a className="read-more" href="#here">
              read more about Student Graduation is Right Around the Corner
            </a>
          </article>
        </main>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

---

# `class` versus `className`

You may have noticed we used `className=` everywhere in the code instead of `class=`.

This is because `JSX` uses the `DOM` names for properties whereas `HTML` uses a more generic name.

In the `DOM` it is the `className` property that `class=` becomes. So we will be using `className` for our class names in JSX.

Don't worry, our `console` will warn us of these types of errors when we make them.

---

# Some CSS to help

Let's use this CSS to make the app look better

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans&display=swap');

:root {
  font: 16px / 1 sans-serif;
}

html {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;

  margin: 0;
  min-height: 100%;
  background-color: #f7f0da;
  color: #2f3737;
}

article {
  max-width: 20rem;
  padding: 1rem 3rem;
  font-size: 0.8rem;
}

article .read-more {
  font-size: 0.6rem;
}

article h2 {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  color: #5a9090;
}

main {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.read-more {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  font-weight: 800;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

---

# Extracting common code into a "component"

- We duplicate code for the `<article>` part of our page.
- React will allow us to make this a generic _component_ and reuse it!

---

# Creating a `NewsArticle` component.

Let's create a new file in the `components` directory and name it
`NewsArticle.jsx`

We'll add this as the first line to tell JavaScript we are going to use `React` and it activates the `JSX` template process.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
```

---

# Next, we will make our component:

```javascript
export class NewsArticle extends React.Component {
  // Code here
}
```

The `export` at the beginning of that line, tells JavaScript we wish to share this class outside of the file. We'll use that fact in just a moment.

---

# Add a default render method

For now, as a test, we'll have it just make a `<div>` with some text

```javascript
export class NewsArticle extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Something</div>
  }
}
```

---

# Prepare `App` to use `NewsArticle`

In `App.jsx` add:

```javascript
import { NewsArticle } from './components/NewsArticle'
```

---

# Use our `NewsArticle`

Add this right inside `<main>`

```html
<NewsArticle />
```

---

# Composition

This is the idea of `composition` -- we are now defining a component, that has its own content, that we can embed into another component, in this case the `App`.

---

# Update the `NewsArticle`

Let's take one example of the news article we have and make it the `render` method's JSX.

```javascript
import React from 'react'

export class NewsArticle extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <article className="intro-article">
        <h2 className="article-title">
          Student Graduation is Right Around the Corner
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our next cohort of students will be graduating in just over a week.
        </p>
        <a className="read-more" href="#here">
          read more about Student Graduation is Right Around the Corner
        </a>
      </article>
    )
  }
}
```

---

# Three Articles

You should notice that our app now has **THREE** articles. The first comes from our `<NewsArticle/>` and the other two from the hardcoded elements.

---

# Cleaning up

Let's remove the other two hardcoded `<article>`s leaving only our `<NewsArticle/>`

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { NewsArticle } from './components/NewsArticle'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="all-main-content">
        <main>
          <NewsArticle />
        </main>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

---

# Make many NewsArticles!

We should only see one article listed. If we repeat the `<NewsArticle/>` we can have as many of the `<article>` structures as we want.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { NewsArticle } from './components/NewsArticle'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="all-main-content">
        <main>
          <NewsArticle />
          <NewsArticle />
          <NewsArticle />
          <NewsArticle />
        </main>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

---

# Reusable but not customizable

---

# Component properties: props

We can add properties to our components by specifying them in a very similar way we would for regular HTML elements.

```html
<NewsArticle
  title="SDG Announces Hackathon!"
  body="SDG announces the 2020 Summer Hackathon. Join us for an exciting weekend"
/>
<NewsArticle
  title="Student Graduation is Right Around the Corner"
  body="Our next cohort of students will be graduating in just over a week."
/>
<NewsArticle
  title="SDG Standardizes on React"
  body="React is the best library for learning front end Web"
/>
```

---

# Using props in a component

All the properties added in the _USAGE_ of a component is present to us inside a component with `this.props`

So our `title` is in a variable named `this.props.title` and our `body` is in a variable called `this.props.body`

In the places where we have hard coded data we can replace with variables

---

# Interpolation of variables in the middle of JSX

To have values appear in our JSX we use `interpolation`

In JSX we write our variables inbetween `{}` characters.

We can replace all the hardcoded text with values from `this.props`

---

```javascript
import React from 'react'

export class NewsArticle extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <article className="intro-article">
        <h2 className="article-title">{this.props.title}</h2>
        <p>{this.props.body}</p>
        <a className="read-more" href="#here">
          read more about {this.props.title}
        </a>
      </article>
    )
  }
}
```

---

# Reusable and Customizable

Now when each of these components is rendered on the page, the unique values for `this.props` are available and we now have a component that is:

- **reusable**
- **customizable**

---

# Driving our application from data

This is great, and we have an application that can render any number of articles we want. However, we still must manually code these in our main application.

It would be nice to render this from the data.

---

## Importing JSON data

Let's start by making a JSON file named `articles.json` in the directory along with `App.jsx`

In this file, we will describe, in JSON, an array of articles we want to render.

We will also give each article an `id` as if it came from an API since that is likely the most common case for where this data will eventually come from.

---

```json
[
  {
    "id": 42,
    "title": "SDG Announces Hackathon!",
    "body": "SDG announces the 2020 Summer Hackathon. Join us for an exciting weekend"
  },
  {
    "id": 99,
    "title": "Student Graduation is Right Around the Corner",
    "body": "Our next cohort of students will be graduating in just over a week."
  },
  {
    "id": 100,
    "title": "SDG Standardizes on React",
    "body": "React is the best library for learning front end Web"
  },
  {
    "id": 101,
    "title": "This data comes from JSON!",
    "body": "React works with data using tools we already know!"
  }
]
```

---

# IMPORTing JSON data

We will be using this in our `App.jsx` so let's import it!

```javascript
import articles from './articles'
```

---

# Transforming data into components

Since we want one `<NewsArticle/>` that is related to each element of the `articles` array, we will bring out our friend `map`

```javascript
const newsArticlesFromData = articles.map(article => (
  <NewsArticle title={article.title} body={article.body} />
))
```

> NOTE: This is a very powerful line of code!

---

# The map essentially creates this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
[
  <NewsArticle title="SDG Announces ..." body="SDG announces ..." />,
  <NewsArticle title="Student Graduation ..." body="Our next cohort ..." />,
  <NewsArticle title="SDG Standardizes ..." body="React is the ..." />,
  <NewsArticle title="This data ..." body="React works ..." />,
]
```

---

# Using the mapped data

Since we now have an array of the `<NewsArticle/>` we can simply place them where we want them in place of the hardcoded data.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { NewsArticle } from './components/NewsArticle'
import articles from './articles'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    const newsArticlesFromData = articles.map(article => (
      <NewsArticle title={article.title} body={article.body} />
    ))

    return (
      <div className="all-main-content">
        <main>{newsArticlesFromData}</main>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

---

# KEYs!

There is one other thing we need to do. If you look in your console you will see a message about each element needing a `key`. There is another React rule that is important to know.

---

[.autoscale: true]

# Rule

> Each component that is rendered dynamically from an array of data must have a unique `key`. That `key` must only be unique for that array of data. (i.e. that same key can be in another array-to-component map in another part of the app, but must be unique for this array)

---

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { NewsArticle } from './components/NewsArticle'
import articles from './articles'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    const newsArticlesFromData = articles.map(article => (
      <NewsArticle key={article.id} title={article.title} body={article.body} />
    ))

    return (
      <div className="all-main-content">
        <main>{newsArticlesFromData}</main>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

---

# KEY property

The `key` prop is a special property and is used by React only. We don't use it with our `NewsArticle` component. In a later lesson, we will learn why this `key` is so important.

---

# Conclusion

- We now have an application that allows us to add more articles to this listing.
- If we add new data to our `JSON` file and reload the application it _reacts_ to the new data by rendering more information.
