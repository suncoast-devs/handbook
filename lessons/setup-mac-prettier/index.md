title: Prettier
---

Developing a clean writing style is just as important when writing code as it is
when writing prose. To help us with developing this style, we can use an
automatic code formatter. This will ensure that our code is formatted with the
proper indentation and the correct placement of syntax.

We will be using the `prettier` formatter for our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
code.

## Installation

```shell
npm install --global prettier
```
