title: Self-Care and Stress Management
order: 1
---

Whether you are a student learning to write clean code, a full-time developer
working with a team, or a freelancer starting to control the projects you work
on, it is essential to make sure you are taking care of your health. As our
lives become more complicated, balancing work, family, friends, and other
responsibilities, we forget about taking care of our own basic needs.

## What is Self-Care?

Self-care is being purposeful in ensuring that you have your needs met, both
physically and mentally. Practicing self-care means that you are prioritizing
yourself as much as you would, family, friends, and your career. (Or whatever
else you consider necessary.)

## So how do you practice self-care?

Practicing self-care is as much about taking care of your mind as your body.

## Watch what you eat

Fuel your body so it can work effectively by eating healthy meals and snacks.
Also, you shouldn't skip meals because you are "too busy" or "just need to
finish this last thing." Keeping your body fueled helps your mind work more
effectively, and no one likes to code hangry.

## Exercise / Take a break

Exercising doesn't mean you have to head to the gym, do a 5 mile run or sweat
for hours. Even a short walk around the block can help. The goal should be to
step away from your computer, give your brain a break, and allow your body to
move. Moving helps avoid back pain, mental frustration, and breaks the monotony
of the day.

Check out some of these exercise options to get you moving:

## Stay hydrated

Keeping your body hydrated goes hand in hand with eating. "Drinking fluids is
crucial to staying healthy and maintaining the function of every system in your
body, including your heart, brain, and muscles." --
[Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-staying-hydrated).
It's easy to think you are hydrating because you are drinking something liquid,
but a large amount of soda/pop or coffee doesn't always give your body what it
needs.

Drinking water isn't always a high priority, sometimes checking out other ways
to get the hydration we need can make staying hydrated easier.

- Water
- Coffee and tea
- Skim and low-fat milk
- Fruits and vegetables
- Oral hydration solutions

## Get enough sleep

> Getting enough sleep is essential for helping a person maintain optimal health
> and well-being. When it comes to their health, sleep is as vital as regular
> exercise and eating a balanced diet. --
> [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325353)

When your body is getting enough sleep, it can help increase your concentration
and productivity. A lack of sleep can slow your learning process and could lead
to making unnecessary mistakes. Your emotions can also run higher when you are
tired, leading to stressed interactions with your family, friends, and peers.
There is also a higher risk of increased Imposter Syndrome, Depression, and can
affect your immune system.

## Eye Care

> "Computer Vision Syndrome, also referred to as Digital Eye Strain, describes a
> group of eye and vision-related problems that result from prolonged computer,
> tablet, e-reader, and cell phone use. Many individuals experience eye
> discomfort and vision problems when viewing digital screens for extended
> periods. The level of discomfort appears to increase with the amount of
> digital screen use." --
> [American Optometric Association](https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/caring-for-your-vision/protecting-your-vision/computer-vision-syndrome)

Developers especially stare at computer screens and other devices continuously
throughout the day; this can lead to symptoms such as:

- eyestrain
- headaches
- blurred vision
- dry eyes
- neck and shoulder pain

So how do you help maintain the health of your eyes?

**Look Away** Taking a break and looking away from your computer can go a long
way to helping protect your eyes.

**Adjust your setup** Tilt the screen slightly to avoid reflections or glare,
make sure the screen is not too close to your face and put the display either at
eye level or slightly lower.

**Glare-blocking tinted computer glasses** There are a variety of frame styles
with varying shades of tinting, even prescription tinted, and prices range greatly to help you find the
right pair for you.

**[F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)** is a program that adjusts a display's
color temperature according to location and time of day, offering functional
respite for the eyes. F.lux reduces eye strain during night-time use, helping to
minimize the disruption of sleep patterns.

**Get your eyes checked** Having your eyes checked on a scheduled basis will
help identify problems early.

### Hand Care

Sitting at a desk and working all day can strain your muscles and joints.

So how do you prevent computer-related injuries?

**Invest in an ergonomic keyboard** "The problem is that the monitor and
keyboard of a laptop are very close together. To position the monitor at the
right height for your back and neck causes you to lift your arms and shoulders
too high. But to position the keyboard at the best height for your arms and
shoulders, you must hunch your shoulders and neck to see the monitor." --
[Better Health](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/computer-related-injuries)

**Use a Mouse** An ergonomic mouse can help reduce strain on your wrists and
hands. If you get a mouse, have your mouse at the same height as your correctly
positioned keyboard and try to place it as close as possible to the side of the
keyboard. Then use your entire arm, not just your wrist, when moving the mouse.

**Adjust your typing style** Do you hit the keyboard hard when typing? Try using
a lighter touch to help reduce the wear and tear on your fingers and wrist.

**Mix up your work to relax your hands** Find other tasks that you can work on
to give you a break away from the keyboard, when doing those tasks give yourself time
to allow your arms to relax and rest in a different position than you would at
the keyboard.

**Stretch** Simple hand stretches can be done anywhere and just once a day or
week will help prevent carpal tunnel

## Body Care

**Use a Standing Desk** If your office provides it, standing desks can be a
great way to relieve pressure on your back and hips from sitting in a chair all
day.

**Try [Chair Yoga](https://chopra.com/articles/chair-yoga-flow-for-all-levels)**
Unlike Yoga poses you might be familiar with, chair yoga is all about stretching
and moving while seated. Chair Yoga is a great alternative when you are in the
office and need to help relax your posture.

**Take care of your Mind** Taking short breaks between spurts of productivity
can provide essential mental rest for overworked minds. The
[Pomodoro method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a system
that breaks up 20-minute intervals with short periods of rest. It works
exceptionally well since you set regular reminders to help you keep taking
breaks.

**Take a Day Off** Between work, online tutorials, and side projects, it's easy
to let programming consume large chunks of your 'off time,' including weekends
and holidays.

## Have Fun

Development doesn't have to be all work and no play. Simple things like
customizing your terminal, buying a colorful keyboard, or decorating your office
space can go a long way.

## Manage your stress

> "Stress wreaks havoc on your emotional equilibrium, as well as your physical
> health. It narrows your ability to think clearly, function effectively, and
> enjoy life. It may seem like there's nothing you can do about stress." --
> [Help Guide](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/stress-management.htm)

Stress Management can help you break the hold stress has on your life so that
you can be happier, healthier, and more productive. So how do you combat stress?

### Identify the sources of stress

Easy to see stressor examples might be changing jobs, moving, relationship
changes, or attending an intensive learning program. It helps to start by
identifying the real source of your stress by looking closely at your habits,
attitude, and excuses:

- Do you explain away stress as temporary, _ "I just have a million things going
  on right now, "_ even though you can't remember the last time you took a
  breather?
- Do you define stress as an integral part of your work or home life _ "Things
  are always crazy around here"_ or as a part of your personality _ "I have a
  lot of nervous energy, that's all"_?
- Do you blame your stress on other people or outside events, or view it as
  entirely usual and unexceptional?

### Avoid, Alter, Adapt & Accept

#### Avoid unnecessary stress

Learn how to say NO. As work life and home life become more complicated, it is
easy to take on too much. Learn to distinguish between the "shoulds" and the
"musts" and ask for help prioritizing if you are not sure of the difference.

Avoid people and situations that stress you out. It is ok to step back and away
when you need time. Take control of your environment by limiting your exposure
and allowing yourself to regroup.

Pare down your to-do list. Use your time management skills to take a look at
what you need to do right now and focus on those. It is ok to postpone less
important tasks for another day.

#### Alter the situation

If something or someone is bothering you, it is essential to express how you
feel. Create open communication where you can share your concerns openly and
respectfully. Part of that conversation should include compromise, working on a
team means finding balance among differing opinions.

Create a balanced schedule, while you are pairing down your to-do list take a
look to see how you can add in things that you enjoy. Make sure to schedule some
time for your family, social activities, and solitary pursuits.

#### Adapt to the stressor

Reframe the problem. Trying to view stressful situations from a more positive
perspective can be difficult, but in the big picture, small stresses can lead to
individual growth and learning.

Adjust your standards; sometimes, we expect perfection. In the world of
development, our code appears broken until it works. Trying to come to terms
with that can be difficult when you expect to get it right the first time.

Practice gratitude. Take a moment to reflect on all the things you appreciate in
your life, including your positive qualities and gifts. Celebrating your
successes, no matter how small, can also help combat stress.

#### Accept things you cannot change

Don't try to control the uncontrollable. Being a developer often means we face
things we cannot control regularly. New features, projects getting canceled, and
bugs that cause something to break are just the tip of the iceberg. Rather than
stressing out over them, focus on the things you can control, such as how you
choose to react to problems.

Look for the upside. When facing challenges, try to look at them as
opportunities for personal growth. When your choices contribute to a stressful
situation, take the time to reflect on them, and learn from your mistakes. Learn
to forgive yourself for the mistakes you made; take your mistakes as an
opportunity to learn and grow to become a better developer.

Share your feelings. Sometimes the most significant stress relief can come from
talking through your problems. Whether you speak to a friend or a counselor
having a sounding board for your worries, challenges, and feelings can bring
comfort and clarity.

When you need extra support, seek a professional. Sometimes taking care of
yourself requires assistance. Seeking professional help does not mean you can't
handle it yourself. Counselors are there to listen, provide support, and offer
feedback when you need it most. Another added benefit is you have someone that
is there to listen to you and only you.
