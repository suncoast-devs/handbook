| Term                 | Definition                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Deserialization`    | Turn a string of characters into more structured data.                                                          |
| `Serialization`      | Turn structured data into a string of characters.                                                               |
| Asynchronous (Async) | Do not wait for this function call to be done, gives the ability to move onto another task in our program.      |
| Await                | When added in front of our function call, this will turn our asynchronous function synchronous.                 |
| Stream               | A variable that knows how to read data one chunk at a time (often one character at a time).                     |
| Try/Catch            | A block of code that allows us to anticipate for exceptions and if found we have the code there to handle them. |
| CRUD                 | Create, Read, Update, and Delete                                                                                |
