# JavaScript Modules

---

## What is a module?

> Any of a number of distinct but interrelated units from which a program may be built up or into which a complex activity may be analysed.
> -- Oxford English Dictionary

---

_tl;dr:_ **A unit of code.**

## Why would I use modules?

Modules help us to:

- write maintainable and testable code.
- write reusable code.

# Modules

> Like a good author will divide a book into chapters; good programmers split a program into modules. -- Somebody, probably

## Modules in JavaScript

^ Prior to a few years ago, no support for modules existed in the JavaScript
language.

^ Competing Standards Emerge

---

## CommonJS Modules

This is the most widely used method of defining modules, used in node and `npm` packages, but it doesn't work well in the browser.

---

## Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)

More complicated to use, but designed to work well in the browser with a loading library, e.g. `require.js`.

---

## ECMAScript 6 Modules

An attempt at supporting the best of both worlds:

- A compact, simple syntax
- Asynchronous loading for browsers

## Can I use ES6 Modules today?

The short answer? [Kind of.](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module)

---

## What does a module look like?

```typescript
// lib/randomInteger.js
function randomInteger(min: number, max: number) {
  min = Math.ceil(min)
  max = Math.floor(max)

  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min
}

export default randomInteger

// main.js
import randomInteger from './lib/randomInteger'

const role = randomInteger(0, 6) + 1
console.log(`You just rolled a ${role}!`)
```

---

## Modules can export more than one thing

```typescript
// lib/util.js
export function squareRoot(number: number) {
  return Math.sqrt(number)
}

export function square(x: number) {
  return x * x
}

export function diagonalLength(x: number, y: number) {
  return squareRoot(square(x) + square(y))
}

// main.js
import { diagonalLength } from './lib/util'

console.log(diagonalLength(4, 3)) // -> 5
```

## See, modules are easy!
