# Questions and tools to help us

    Do you understand every word used within the problem statement?
    Use your own words to describe the problem.
    If needed, make a drawing depicting the situation.
    Have you solved any similar problem?
    What data or resources are provided within the statement?
    What data or results are requested within the statement?
    Is it possible to simplify the problem by dividing it into simpler cases?
    Do you know any hand-written way to solve the problem?

# Restating the problem in your own, more detailed, words

By rewriting the problem statement in your own words and increasing the difficulty we start the process of making connections.

Problems are often written poorly

    "Go to the store to get a steak, and if they have eggs, get six"

    Sends person to the store and they come back with six steaks.
    Why, because they had eggs.

# Drawing helps!

Often drawing diagrams helps understand the problem and the **flow** of information.

Does not matter, find what works best for **you**

# [fit] Have you solved a similar problem?

The more problems you solve the more similar they become.

We'll fill up our "bag of tricks" with techniques that can we can apply.

# [fit] What data or resources are provided?

When working on algorithms, examples are üéÅ üéÅ üéÅ!

Use the examples given.

Create your own.

In creating your own examples you begin working on the algorithm!

---

# [fit] Can you break the problem into small parts?

Solving smaller parts is easier.

Putting the smaller solutions together may just involve conditions or looping.

---

# [fit] Can you find a manual way to solve the problem?

This is a "half way" state to an algorithm.

Think of it as a "rough draft" of your algorithm.
