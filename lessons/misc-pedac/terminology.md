| Problem         | Restate the Problem in your own, more specific terms.                                                                                                    |
| Examples        | Generate example inputs and see if you can work out the answer. Make sure to look for edge cases.                                                        |
| Data Structures | The types of variables you will be dealing with in the problem. Ex. Type of input, type of output, "local" information that may need to be tracked, etc. |
| Algorithm       | A formal set of instructions for solving the problem.                                                                                                    |
| Code            | Write out the code for the problem to see if it is working or needs to be refactored.                                                                    |
