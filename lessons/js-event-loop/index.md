title: The Event Loop

The browser, and JavaScript are inherently asynchronous enviroments. That is various tasks can be happening at the same time.

- How does this change how our code behaves?

The browser implements this idea in something called an `Event Loop`. This [video from JS Conf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&vl=en) titled `What the heck is the event loop anyway?` by _Philip Roberts_ is a great explanation of this idea.
