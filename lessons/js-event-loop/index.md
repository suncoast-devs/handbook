title: The Event Loop
---

The browser, and JavaScript are inherently asynchronous environments. This means
various tasks can be happening at the same time.

- How does the browser support this?
- How does this change how our code behaves?

The browser implements this idea in something called an `Event Loop`. This
[video from JS Conf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&vl=en) titled
`What the heck is the event loop anyway?` by _Philip Roberts_ is a great
explanation of this idea.
