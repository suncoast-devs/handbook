# Program Catalog

To answer questions about our team, faculty, curriculum, classwork, homework,
and schedule we've put together a
[program catalog](https://suncoast.io/catalog.pdf) for you. Please read the
entire catalog. If you have any additional questions, reach out to the Suncoast
Developers Guild team.

The [program catalog](https://suncoast.io/catalog.pdf) covers topics such as:

- Our Team
- Curriculum
- Classwork and Homework Requirements
- Daily Schedule
- Program Costs
- Evaluation and Graduation Requirements

You will need to sign off that you have read the
[program catalog](https://suncoast.io/catalog.pdf) on a form later in the
pre-work.
