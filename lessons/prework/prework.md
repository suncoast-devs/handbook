title: Practice Pre-work
order: 9
---

Pre-work is material that ensures you have the necessary foundation required for
the course. Starting learning before the program is like training for a
marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start; you need to train
beforehand. In our program, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This
pre-work is training for your brain.

# Starting in the back

Our full time program _begins_ with work on the Back End of a website. That is,
all of the code that deals with keeping track of data, storing it in a database,
searching, sorting, collating, and delivering information to the front end of a
website.

Websites are served from a web server running some back-end language, such as
Ruby, Python, or .NET. During the course, you are studying a back-end language
to learn more in depth. There are plenty of back-end languages to choose from.
Each language has its strengths and weakness. We have chosen to focus on `C#`
and `.NET`.

### Explore C\# \("c-sharp"\) & .NET

`.NET` is a robust framework built by Microsoft. While there are many languages
that use the `.NET` ecosystem, `C#` is a common, flexible, and ubiquitous
language.

[the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/) are
usually a great place to start once you learn a little from the above tutorials

## Fundamentals and Front End Development

## Start with the HTML and CSS

Start with some HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are the essentially what the web is
all about. HTML and CSS are what the user sees and interacts with the most.
Since these two languages are fundamental, this is the best place to get your
feet wet.

## Add some life with JavaScript

JavaScript allows to create interactive and dynamic websites. This is what
brings our websites to life. This will also help us learn the fundamentals of
how computers run lines of code. JavaScript runs on the client side, which means
the users computer. Every website that you have visited, uses JavaScript in some
way.
