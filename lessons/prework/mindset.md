## Fixed vs. Growth Mindset

You are about to enter a time of intense mindset growth. Being aware of fixed
mindsets and growth mindsets help prepare you to focus on growth.

Read
[Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)
and watch
[Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1CHPnZfFmU)

Success in our program will require you to focus on a growth mindset. During the
course check in with yourself to see if you are experiencing a fixed mindset.

## Realize Your Learning Style

Developers are lifelong learners. The tech field is ever-growing and
ever-changing. Learning is a particular skill to hone. During the course, this
skill is sharpened to help you on the route to success. Understanding how you
learn helps put any developer, both new and veteran, on a path to success.

There are many different models of how people learn. One such model is the
[VARK](http://vark-learn.com/introduction-to-vark/). VARK breaks down how people
tend to learn and teach.

[Take the VARK questionnaire](http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/) to
see how you learn best.

Take your time while taking this short quiz. After a few questions, you start to
see a pattern of how you prefer to communicate. Use the results not as concrete
life-changing facts but rather as self-reflection to help you consume, apply and
eventually share new information.

## Taking care of yourself

You are about to embark on a journey of personal and professional growth. There
will be highs and lows.
[Self Care](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/Steps%20to%20Wellbeing.pdf) is
important!
