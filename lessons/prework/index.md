title: Web Development Program Pre-work
---

## Summary

Welcome to the Suncoast Developers Guild pre-work. These resources are designed
to help you get ready to be successful in the program.

## What is Pre-work?

Pre-work is a series of articles, videos, blogs and other useful information
designed to set you up for success at Suncoast Developers Guild. In addition to
setting context, this will help start your journey on the right path and help
frame what and how you will be learning.

## Why Does Pre-Work Help?

You are about to begin a demanding and fast-paced program. The pre-work is
designed to help you understand the challenge you are about to undertake and to
help you consider "how" you learn. You have chosen to enter a program where you
will be guided by a curriculum and by instructors and teaching assistants.

We have designed this curriculum so that even students who have never done any
programming or even have skipped this pre-work you are reading now will be
successful.

## What Won't the Pre-Work Do For You?

Pre-work is not "pre-study" nor is it meant to "give you a leg up" on your first
day, or even your first week, of the class. Pre-work is not designed to try to
explain everything about web development. We use it to establish context and a
shared language to jump-start the learning process.
