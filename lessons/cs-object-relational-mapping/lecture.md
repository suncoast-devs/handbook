# [fit] Entity Framework

---

We would like to use a relational database in our systems.

However, our systems are Object Oriented. We aren't coding in the landscape of tables and rows, but lists and objects.

---

## Enter the Object Relational Mapper (ORM)

Luckily we have a concept called an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The purpose of an ORM is to seamlessly translate between the language of lists/objects to tables/rows.

With an ORM we can continue to use all of our familiar `C#` ideas and allow the ORM to take care of the details of the appropriate _SQL_ and _relational database_ work.

# [fit] Enter Entity Framework Core for .NET

In `.NET Core` we will be using the `Entity Framework` as our ORM of choice.

This will allow us to setup relationships between our database tables and our `C#` classes.

We will refer to these as `POCO`s -- Plain Old C-Sharp Objects.

# Creating our first EF Core application

Start by making a plain console application so we can prompt the user if needed as well as output information.

```shell
dotnet new sdg-console -o SuncoastMovies
```

---

We will also need to add the Entity Framework library to our project.

This adds PostgreSQL support for Entity Framework.

```shell
cd SuncoastMovies
dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
```

---

# [fit] Define our first Model

We will begin by accessing the list of _movies_ from our database from our `C#` code.

Before we can do that we need to teach `C#` about the structure of a movie.

We can do that by defining a `class` named `Movie` (singular) and give it properties corresponding to the same names we find in our table.

---

In our `Movie.cs` we can add `class Movie` as such:

```csharp
using System;

namespace SuncoastMovies
{
  class Movie
  {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string PrimaryDirector { get; set; }
    public int YearReleased { get; set; }
    public string Genre { get; set; }
  }
}
```

---

# Conventions

Notice how we have modeled the property names and types to match the column names and types in the database.

This is how `EF Core` will know how to **MAP** the information between our table and our objects.

Here we are following a _convention_ that allows us to keep the same ideas between our object world and our database world.

---

# Connecting to the database through a context

To connect our POCO models to the database we use a `Database Context`, or `DbContext` for short.

The purpose of the database context is to tell our code what models in the database are accessible as well as how to connect to the database.

---

# `SuncoastMoviesContext.cs`

```csharp
class SuncoastMoviesContext : DbContext
{
  public DbSet<Movie> Movies { get; set; }

  protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
  {
    optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql("server=localhost;database=SuncoastMovies");
  }
}
```

---

# Walk through

It is derived from `DbContext` which is provided by EF Core.

The `DbContext` is what allows us to connect to our database and relate our models to tables.

---

# Walk through

We then define a property `Movies` (plural) which we state is of type `DbSet<Movie>`.

The `Movie` here is the model we wish to relate and `Movies` corresponds to the `Movies` table in our database.

`DbSet` will act much like our `List` collection but has much more knowledge of how to read and write from the database.

---

# Walk through

Finally, we **override** a method required by `EF Core` that tells us how to connect to the database.

<br/>

EF Core will call this method to setup the connection to the database.

In here we tell the options we are using a postgres database (`UseNpgsql`) and that the database is named `SuncoastMovies` and is on our local machine.

---

# [fit] Using the context to get at data

```csharp
// Get a new context which will connect to the database
var context = new SuncoastMoviesContext();
```

With this object we access our `Movies` property:

```csharp
// This would represent the "movies" table in our database
context.Movies;
```

---

# [fit] Using our Movies

Now with this `movies` object we can use some of our familiar `LINQ` capabilities.

We start by seeing how we would count the number of movies in the table.

```csharp
var movieCount = context.Movies.Count();
Console.WriteLine($"There are {movieCount} movies!");
```

---

This should seem familiar as the `movies.Count()` statement eventually becomes a `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM MOVIES` in our database.

This is a perfect example of the idea of an ORM.

At the level of `C#` we are working with a `DbSet` and the `Count()` method from LINQ.

However, EF Core is translating this to the appropriate SQL statements and returning us the data we need.

---

# [fit] Getting a list of all the movies

To see all of the movies, we can use a `foreach` loop:

```csharp
foreach (var movie in context.Movies)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"There is a movie named {movie.Title}");
}
```

---

Again, translated to SQL this would be `SELECT * FROM MOVIES`. However, here we receive instances of our `Movie` class we can use to output information such as each movie object's title: `movie.Title`. 

---

# Bonus: Seeing what SQL our code is generating.

Before we can use the logger we must add another package to our application:

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console
```

Then we can add this code to our `OnConfiguring` method:

```csharp
var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder => builder.AddConsole());
optionsBuilder.UseLoggerFactory(loggerFactory);
```

---

# Adding in related tables.

Our database has other tables we could add to our system: `Ratings`, `Roles`, and `Actors`.

Lets add a model for our ratings.

```csharp
class Rating
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Description { get; set; }
}
```

---

# [fit] Add the model to the context

```csharp
public DbSet<Rating> Ratings { get; set; }
```

---

# Update the Movie model

```csharp
public int RatingId { get; set; }
public Rating Rating { get; set; }
```

---

# Fetch movies and ratings

This tells the `Movie` model that it can use the `Rating` property to return a `Rating` object.

Now when we access the `context.Movies` we can also tell it to fetch the related `Rating` via the `Include` method.

```csharp
var moviesWithRatings = context.Movies.Include(movie => movie.Rating);
```

---

# Showing movies and ratings

```csharp
var moviesWithRatings = context.Movies.Include(movie => movie.Rating);
foreach (var movie in moviesWithRatings)
{
  if (movie.Rating == null)
  {
    Console.WriteLine($"Movie {movie.Title} - no rating");
  }
  else
  {
    Console.WriteLine($"Movie {movie.Title} - {movie.Rating.Description}");
  }
}
```

---


# Add in other relationships.

Finally, we can add the relationships for `Role` and `Actor`.

```csharp
class Movie
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Title { get; set; }
  public string PrimaryDirector { get; set; }
  public int YearReleased { get; set; }
  public string Genre { get; set; }

  public int RatingId { get; set; }
  public Rating Rating { get; set; }

  public List<Role> Roles { get; set; }
}
```

---

# Add in other relationships.

```csharp
class Role
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string CharacterName { get; set; }

  public int MovieId { get; set; }
  public Movie Movie { get; set; }

  public int ActorId { get; set; }
  public Actor Actor { get; set; }
}
```


---


```csharp
// Makes a new collection of movies but each movie knows the associated Rating object
var moviesWithRatingsRolesAndActors = context.Movies.
                                        // from our movie, please include the associated Rating object
                                        Include(movie => movie.Rating).
                                        // ... and from our movie, please include the associated Roles LIST
                                        Include(movie => movie.Roles).
                                        // THEN for each of roles, please include the associated Actor object
                                        ThenInclude(role => role.Actor);

foreach (var movie in moviesWithRatingsRolesAndActors)
{
  if (movie.Rating == null)
  {
    Console.WriteLine($"{movie.Title} - not rated");
  }
  else
  {
    Console.WriteLine($"{movie.Title} - {movie.Rating.Description}");
  }

  foreach (var role in context.Movie.Roles)
  {
    Console.WriteLine($" - {role.CharacterName} played by {role.Actor.FullName}");
  }
}
```

---

# Adding data

To add a `Movie` to the record we can make a new POCO like we always do.

```csharp
var newMovie = new Movie {
  Title = "SpaceBalls",
  PrimaryDirector = "Mel Brooks",
  Genre = "Comedy",
  YearReleased = 1987,
  RatingId = 2
};
```

---

# Saving

Then we can add this POCO to the `Movies` context and tell the context to save the changes

```csharp
context.Movies.Add(newMovie);
context.SaveChanges();
```

---

# Updating

```csharp
var existingMovie = context.Movies.FirstOrDefault(movie => movie.Title == "SpaceBalls");

if (existingMovie != null) {
  existingMovie.Title = "SpaceBalls - the best movie ever";

  context.SaveChanges();
}
```

---

# Deleting a movie

To remove a movie we find the movie and then remove it.

```csharp
var existingMovieToDelete = context.Movies.FirstOrDefault(movie => movie.Title == "Cujo");

if (existingMovieToDelete != null) {
  context.Movies.Remove(existingMovieToDelete);

  context.SaveChanges();
}
```
