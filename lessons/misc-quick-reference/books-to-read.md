## This is a great "career" book. It talks about the habits good developers have

- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://smile.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1)

## A great, deep, background on how computers and code actually work

- [Code](https://smile.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Developer-Practices-ebook/dp/B00JDMPOK2/ref=sr_1_1)

## Interesting book on secrecy/cryptograph

- [The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography](https://smile.amazon.com/Code-Book-Science-Secrecy-Cryptography-ebook/dp/B004IK8PLE/ref=sr_1_9)

## Good guide if you work with an existing code base!

- [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0131177052)

## Good refactoring book, based on Ruby but might be good for non-rubyists too

- [Refactoring: Ruby Edition: Ruby Edition](https://smile.amazon.com/Refactoring-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321984137)

## This is not really for a junior level coding interview, but might be a good reference anyway. I haven't read it but others have recommended it.

- [Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions](https://github.com/gstark/juniors/blob/master/smile.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_sim_14_84)
