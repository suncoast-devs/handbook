# Security Now (a podcast about security, the internet, and tech)

## How the Internet Works

("How the internet works" talk starts at 8:30)

> During this 49-minute episode, Leo and I briefly discuss the 'Kama Sutra'
> virus that will become destructive on February 3rd. We briefly discuss PC
> World Magazine's recent evaluation and ranking of ten top anti-malware
> systems. And we begin our long-planned 'fundamental technology' series with a
> two-part close look at the history and detailed operation of the global
> Internet.

## How the Internet Works Part Two

> Leo and I discuss questions asked by listeners of our previous episodes. We
> tie up loose ends, explore a wide range of topics that are too small to fill
> their own episode, clarify any confusion from previous installments, and
> present real world "application notes" for any of the security technologies we
> have previously discussed.

## How Local Area Networks Work

> Having covered the operation of the Internet's WAN (Wide Area Network)
> technology in the past two weeks, this week Leo and I turn to discussing the
> way Local Area Networks (LANs) operate and how they interface with the
> Internet WAN. We address the configuration of subnet masks, default gateways,
> and DHCP to explain how packets are routed among machines and gateways within
> a LAN.

## The SSL/TLS Protocol

> Leo and I plow into the detailed operation of the Internet's most-used
> security protocol, originally called "SSL" and now evolved into "TLS." The
> security of this crucial protocol protects all of our online logins, financial
> transactions, and pretty much everything else.

## Design a Computer - Part One

> To understand the advances made during 50 years of computer evolution, we need
> to understand computers 50 years ago. In this first installment of a new
> Security Now series, we design a 50 year old computer. In future weeks, we
> will trace the factors that shaped their design during the four decades that
> followed.

> and transistors can be used to assemble logical functions, this week Steve and
> Leo use those functions to build a working digital computer that understands a
> simple but entirely useful and workable machine language.

## Indirection: The Power of Pointers

> A feature present in the earliest commercial computers, known as
> “indirection”, has proven to be necessary, powerful, beneficial . . . and
> amazingly dangerous and difficult for programmers to “get right”. This week,
> Leo and I examine the Power of Pointers and why, even after all these years,
> they continue to bedevil programmers of all ages.

## Hardware Interrupts

> In this fourth installment of Steve's “How Computers Work” series, Steve

> needs of the hardware that interacts with the outside world while they are in
> the middle of doing other things.
