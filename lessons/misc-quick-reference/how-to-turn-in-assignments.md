title: Turning in Assignments
---

Follow these steps to turn in, and get credit for your homework.

You should complete all the tasks listed for _explorer_ mode first. Then follow
these instructions for turning in that work. If you choose to proceed to
_adventure_ or _epic_ modes you should follow these instructions _again_ to turn
in each of those modes.

**NOTE**: All the following commands need to be run in your terminal and
_inside_ the project directory. You need to `cd` into the directory where your
project exists.

### Step 1: Commit your code to GitHub

Once you are done, you will want to commit your code:

In the terminal, run:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Done with explorer mode."
```

** NOTE **: Please replace _"Done with explorer mode."_ with a more meaningful
message. It should try to capture what work you did.

Push our local commits to GitHub:

```shell
git push
```

### Step 2: Turning your code in.

Once you have your code deployed and pushed to GitHub, visit Nexus and bring up
the assignment. Click the `Turn In` button. Select the GitHub repository you
created. Add a comment to let your instructor know anything specific about the
state of your work. For example if you had any issues or challenges, this is
where you would document those.

After you have turned in your code, your instructor evaluates your work, and
leave any comments. If deemed incomplete or unaccepted the instructor re-opens
the issue with a list of items to complete before turning in the assignment
again.
