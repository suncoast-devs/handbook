title: Managing Windows
---

Effective management of windows on your desktop will be an important aspect of
finding a workflow that is comfortable for you. As a developer you'll have many
applications open at once. For instance to work on one project you might have
these applications/tools open:

- Visual Studio Code
- Browser for looking at your web app
- Browser for looking up documentation
- Two or more Terminal / Power Shells
- Insomnia API tool

Learning to place these apps and quickly find them will be essential

## Navigate open applications

On the Mac: Hold down the COMMAND key and hit TAB to cycle through open
applications. (use SHIFT COMMAND and TAB to cycle in the reverse direction)

On Windows; Hold down the ALT key and hit TAB to cycle through open
applications.

## Snapping windows to the edge

On the Windows OS you can snap windows to the edges of your display with your
mouse and keyboard. See this
[guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241)
to learn how.

On the Mac, I recommend using a third party tool for snapping windows. One such
FREE application is [Ractangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) By downloading and
installing this app you can use keyboard shortcuts to snap windows to the sides
and tops of your screen or drag windows to the edge to snap them.
