# Firefox

We recommend using [Firefox](https://firefox.com) during this course.

We are going to be using Firefox's `Development Tools` feature extensively when
developing front-end applications. Even if you do not use Firefox for your web
browsing experience, having all of your fellow students on the same development
tools will help.

## Installation

<OperatingSystemSwitch allowedOperatingSystems={['Mac']}>

```shell
brew install --cask firefox
```

</OperatingSystemSwitch>

<OperatingSystemSwitch allowedOperatingSystems={['Windows']}>

```shell
scoop install firefox
```

</OperatingSystemSwitch>

# Prettier

Developing a clean writing style is just as important when writing code as it is
when writing prose. To help us with developing this style, we can use an
automatic code formatter. This will ensure that our code is formatted with the
proper indentation and the correct placement of syntax.

We will be using the `prettier` formatter for our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
code.

## Installation

```shell
npm install --global prettier
```
