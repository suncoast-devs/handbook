# Developer Tools

This guide will walk you through installing all of the developer tools we will
use during this course. While you may not understand yet _why_ we are installing
each of these software tools, you will encounter and use each of them during
this course.

Several sections may have different setup instructions based on the operating
system of your computer. The guide will attempt to detect your operating system
correctly. If you need to change the operating system setting, you may toggle
between the choices using icons on the right side of the page.
