In this lesson we will learn how to use TypeScript code to interact with our web
pages. Without TypeScript our browsers cannot manipulate page beyond the static
version present when the page is first loaded.

We will learn how to access the `Document Object Model` and use TypeScript to
read, add, change, and remove elements from it.
