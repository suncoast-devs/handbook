# Algorithms

Like any good presentation, let us give the boring definition.

---

# Definition (1/3)

    Self-contained step-by-step
    set of operations to be
    performed.

---

# Definition (2/3)

    Algorithms perform calculations,
    data processing, and/or
    automated reasoning tasks.

---

# Definition (3/3)

    An algorithm is an effective
    method that can be expressed
    within a finite amount of
    space and time and in a
    well-defined formal language
    for calculating a function.

---

![fit](assets/break-it-down.jpg)

^ When starting with algorithms, the more detail we include, even to the point where it may seem silly, the better developers we will be.

---

    1. Read the problem completely twice.
    2. Solve the problem manually with several sets of sample data.
    3. Optimize the manual steps.
    4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
    5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
    6. Optimize the real code.

^ https://simpleprogrammer.com/2011/01/08/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/

---

# Read the problem completely twice.

    - Most important!
    - Can you explain it (simply) to someone else?

---

# Solve the problem manually

    - Programming is automation
    - Solve the problem manually
    - Maybe even on pen and paper
    - Or use physical objects
    - Practice!

---

# Optimize the manual solution

    - Can you remove any steps?

---

# Write pseudo-code or comments

    - Open an editor and write the manual steps in English

---

# Replace comments with real code

    - Replace each individual step with code

# Example

<br/>

## [fit] Reverse a string (word)

^ Our goal is to be able to reverse any string (word) ^ How would we break this
down into tiny steps

---

# `P`roblem

Given a word, which is just a sequence of letters, make a new word with the same sequence of letters in reverse order.

---

# `E`xamples

|         |         |
| ------- | ------- |
| zebra   | arbez   |
| word    | drow    |
| rotator | rotator |

^
`File.read("/usr/share/dict/words").split("\n").filter { |word| word.reverse == word }.sort_by(&:length)`

---

# `D`ata (structures)

- `string`
- loops

---

# `A` lgorithm ...

Start by using a specific example...

    1. Write “Zebra” down.
    2. Create a new empty word.
    2. Start at the last letter in the word (the "a" from Zebra)
    3. Put the current letter at the end of the new word
    4. If there is a previous letter,
       make the previous letter the current letter
       and start back at 3.
    5. When there are no more letters in the word, our
       new word is the answer.

---

# Pseudo code

    1. NewWord = ""
    2. Loop backwards through word to reverse
    3.   NewWord += CurrentLetter
    4. Return NewWord

---

# Code (Ruby)

```ruby
word = "Zebra"

new_word = ""
word.chars.reverse_each do |letter|
  new_word += letter
end

new_word # => "arbeZ"
```

# What are we measuring?

When we speak of algorithm complexity, what are we measuring?

- Operations
- Comparisons
- Increments

^ TODO: Maybe mention Turing Machine here?

---

# Example: Searching

---

![fit](assets/binary-and-linear-search-animations.gif)

^ Binary search: we half the amount of comparisons we need to do each time we
make a decision. This is worst case log(n)

^ The linear search has to compare every element until it finds it. Worst case
is O(n)

---

# [fit] Big O notation

---

> `O(1)`

> `O(log n)`

> `O(n)`

> `O(n log n)`

> `O(n^2)`

> `O(2^n)`

- These grow at a different rate based on how `n` changes

---

> `O(1)`

    Takes a constant amount of time regardless of input size

    Example: looking up an index in an array
             looking up a key in a hash/dictionary (most cases)

---

> `O(n)`

    If n doubles, the algorithm takes twice as long

    Example: linear search animation

---

> `O(n^2)`

    If n doubles, the algorithm takes FOUR times as long

    Example: bubble sort!

---

> `O(2^n)`

    If n doubles, the algorithm takes many times as long

    e.g., if n grows from 20 to 40, O(2^n) grows by over a MILLION times

    Example: Tower of Hanoi

---

# Tower of Hanoi

    The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle.

    It consists of three rods and several disks
    of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod.

    The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack
    in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest
    at the top, thus making a conical shape.

---

# Tower of Hanoi

    The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire

    stack to another rod, obeying simple rules

---

# Tower of Hanoi

    1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.

    2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk
       from one of the stacks and placing it on top
       of another stack i.e. a disk can only be
       moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.

    3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
