title: Terminal
---

The default color scheme for `Terminal` is black text on a while background.
This can be difficult to use for long periods of time. Consider changing your
default profile to `Pro` which will give you light text on a dark background.

Recommended profiles:

- Pro
- Homebrew
- TheOne

To change your default profile, start `Terminal` and select `Preferences` from
the _Terminal_ menu. Click on `Profiles` then on `Pro` (or any other profile you
want) and then click the `Default` button.

> NOTE: if you choose a profile that is bright and colorful, but difficult for
> your instructor or fellow classmates to read you will be making it more
> challenging to receive assistance.

## Make the window full height and width

The normal size for a terminal window is quite small. Often we'll need much more
room to see all the details we'll need. The best way is to make our terminal
windows take up the full height and width of our windows.

To do this:

- Start Terminal
- Under the Terminal menu choose "Preferences"
- Click on the Profiles tab
- Click on the text `Windows` on the right hand tab list. (HINT: It is in the
  list `Text`, `Window`, `Tab`, `Shell`, `Keyboard`, `Advanced`)
- In the section "Window Size" enter `1000` for both `Columns` and `Rows`
- Close the preferences window
