| Method                                                                                                                   | A block of code that performs a function.                                                               |
| Input                                                                                                                    | Also known as parameters, These are the information the method needs from the code _using_ it. These    |
| are surrounded by parentheses and are separated by commas. Empty parentheses indicate that the method has no parameters. |
| Work                                                                                                                     | `body` of the method composed of lines of code.                                                         |
| Output                                                                                                                   | Known as the `return` type. The `void` type is used if the                                              |
| method doesn't return anything.                                                                                          |
| return                                                                                                                   | This statement tells the method to stop processing and `return`                                         |
| whatever information is in the supplied variable.                                                                        |
| Pascal Case (capital case)                                                                                               | If the method name would be multiple words in a normal sentence we remove the spaces and capitalize the |
| beginning of each word.                                                                                                  |
