That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't useful on
their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an
entire HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here we have:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: The doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young
  (about 1991/2), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the
  HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic
  error checking and other helpful things. They used to look something like
  this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
```

- However, these days no one cares about them, and they are just historical
  artifacts that need to be included for everything to work right.
  `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid
  doctype; that's all you need to know.
- `<html></html>`: The `<html>` element. This element wraps all the content on
  the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.
- `<head></head>`: The `<head>` element. This element acts as a container for
  all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you
  are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like page title and a
  page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our
  content, character set declarations and more. You'll learn more about this in
  the next article in the series.
- `<meta charset="utf-8">`: This element sets the character set your document
  should use to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of
  human written languages. Essentially it can now handle any textual content you
  might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid
  some problems later.
- `<title></title>`: The `<title>` element. This element sets the title of your
  page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded
  in, and is used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.
- `<body></body>`: The `<body>` element. This element contains all of the
  content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether
  that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
