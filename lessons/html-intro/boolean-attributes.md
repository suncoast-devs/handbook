You'll sometimes see attributes written without values â€” this is perfectly
allowed. These are called boolean attributes, and they can only have one value,
which is generally the same as the attribute name. As an example, take the
`disabled` attribute, which you can assign to form input elements if you want
them to be disabled (greyed out) so the user can't enter any data in them.

As a shorthand, it is perfectly allowable to write this as follows (we've also
included a non-disabled form input element for reference to give you more of an
idea of what is going on):

<pre data-lang='html'>
{`

<input type="text" value="I am disabled" disabled="disabled" />

<input type="text" value="I am also disabled" disabled>

<input type="text" value="I am enabled">
`}
</pre>

</CodePen>
