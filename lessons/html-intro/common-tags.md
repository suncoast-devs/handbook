### [nav](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav)

> element to represent it — contained within an HTML document.

### [main](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main)

### [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article)

> Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or
> site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g.,

> article, or a blog entry.

> text representation of the source can be given using the `<cite>` element.
