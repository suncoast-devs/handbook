title: What is HTML?
order: 2

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup
language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It
can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML
consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up
different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The
enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another
page on the web, italicize words, and so on.

For example, take the following line of content.

<pre data-lang='html'>
{`
My cat is very grumpy
`}
</pre>

</CodePen>

If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a
paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (`<p>`) element:

<pre data-lang='html'>
{`
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
`}
</pre>

</CodePen>
