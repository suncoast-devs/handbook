HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup
language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It
can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes for it to be.
HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark
up different content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags
can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web,
italicize words, and so much more.

For example, take the following line of content.

<pre data-lang='html'>
{`
My cat is very grumpy
`}
</pre>

</CodePen>

If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a
paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (`<p>`) element:

<pre data-lang='html'>
{`
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
`}
</pre>

</CodePen>
