HTML is the most basic structure of a webpage. All other languages, frameworks,
etcetera on the web form themselves around the foundation of HTML.

Its primary purpose is to put text, pictures, and links onto a website. If
you're only doing that, it will remain pretty simple. As you begin learning more
of the tools it has to offer, you will realize that it can do quite a bit more.

In this guide we cover the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started. We
define elements, attributes, and the other important terms you may have heard
and where they fit into the language. We also show how an HTML element is
structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and explain other important
basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you
interested!
