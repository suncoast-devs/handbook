title: Empty elements
order: 5
tags:
  - mdn-content

Not all elements follow the above pattern of opening tag, content, and then
closing tag. Some elements consist only of a single tag, which is usually used
to insert/embed something in the document at the place it is included. For
example, the `<img>` element embeds an image file onto a page in the position it
is included in:

```html
<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"
/>
```

This would output the following on your page:

<div>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"/>
</div>
