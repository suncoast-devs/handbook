In the above examples, you may have noticed that a lot of whitespace is included
in the code listings — this is not necessary at all; the two following code
snippets are equivalent:

```html
<p>Dogs are silly.</p>

<p>Dogs are silly.</p>
```

No matter how much whitespace you use (which can include space characters but
also line breaks), the HTML parser reduces each one down to a single space when
rendering the code. So why use so much whitespace? The answer is readability —
it is much easier to understand what is going on in your code if you have it
nicely formatted and not just bunched up together in a big mess. In our HTML,
we've got each nested element indented by two spaces more than the one it's
sitting inside. It is up to you what style of formatting you use (how many
spaces for each level of indentation, for example), but you should consider
formatting it.
