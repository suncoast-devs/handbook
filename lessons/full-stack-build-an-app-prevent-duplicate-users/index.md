## Avoid duplicate email addresses

To make the email unique, we can add a _unique index_ on the field. Indexes are
a database optimization technique that allows the database to have fast access
to looking up information based on a specific column. We automatically get an
index on our `Id` column to make those lookups fast. Most of the databases we've
worked with so far haven't been so extensive that indexes aren't needed to make
them fast. However, we are going to use them here to enforce uniqueness.

When creating an index, we specify the columns involved. Selecting the columns
makes lookups for values in those columns fast. Of course, creating an index
takes up more space in our database. It also makes **inserting** data slower
since it needs to insert data into our table and update the index information.

One of the aspects we can make of an index is to specify that for the column, or
columns involved that the values be **unique**.

To create our unique index, we will add some code to our `DatabaseContext`
model.

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
   modelBuilder.Entity<User>().HasIndex(user => user.Email) .IsUnique();
}
```

Then we will generate a migration:

```shell
dotnet ef migrations add AddUserEmailIndex
```

Then run the migration:

```shell
dotnet ef database update
```

If we attempt to create a user with a duplicate email address, we will get an
_exception_ in our controller. To handle that, we will _catch_ the exception and
instead of terminating the request, we will send back a custom error message:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public async Task<ActionResult<User>> PostUser(User user)
{
    try
    {

        // Indicate to the database context we want to add this new record
        _context.Users.Add(user);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();

        // Return a response that indicates the object was created (status code `201`) and some additional
        // headers with details of the newly created object.
        return CreatedAtAction("GetUser", new { id = user.Id }, user);
    }
    catch (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbUpdateException)
    {
        // Make a custom error response
        var response = new
        {
            status = 400,
            errors = new List<string>() { "This account already exists!" }
        };

        // Return our error with the custom response
        return BadRequest(response);
    }
}
```

Since we are generating the error in the same format as validation errors, we
will get a nice error in the UI when someone attempts to use an email address
that exists.
