Your github account is where you will be storing all of the work you do in these
lessons and assignments. It will become part of your _portfolio_ or work and
document your journey of learning.

It is also how you will be tracking your assignments and turning in your
homework.

## Creating a github account

Start by following the `Sign Up` link on
[github's home page](https://github.com).

**Choosing a username** - We recommend using a version of your given name. This
would be a version of the name you would put at the top of the resume you'd send
a prospective employer. You might be tempted to select a username like
`kewldev98` but remember that a hiring manager **WILL** seek out your github
page and you want it to have a professional feel.

## Uploading a profile photo

**Use a good headshot photo** - Use the best photo you have of you that shows
your face. We recommend this because you want other developers, hiring managers,
and companies to start recognizing you. Use your best photo. If you need a
professional photo let us know and we can help.
