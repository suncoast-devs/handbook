CSS Warm up!

Recreate the layout for this page:

http://florianmarkl.com/

## Explorer

- Only worry about the boxes and their positioning, do not worry about the rotating the text, at first
- pay attention to how it (doesn't) change when the browser is smaller

## Adventure

- Rotate the text

## Epic

- Do this using CSS Grids
- Make this in a react-app, and use `<Link/>` to make the boxes hyperlinks
