# Sample Questions

Technical interviews is a skill that requires practice. We have gathered some sample questions that we have heard are used or have been used by community members in hiring. These are not the only questions out there, but the types of questions that might be. 

When using these questions try to avoid using `canned answers`. Also,  it's usually not about giving the correct answer, but more along the lines of giving a `good` answer. A `good` answer is an answer that shows the employers what you know, no more no less, and you can talk about technology and tech ideas. Its all about finding out what you know, what you don't know and how you work.

## General Questions

Tools and preferences on tech:

- What are your favorite tools? designing, prototyping, coding
- How do you keep up with tech?
- If you had to pick a new fresh (full or just front end) stack today, what would you pick? Why?
- What is the last thing you built? What was the last feature you added?

Workflow:

- What are your problem-solving steps?
- How do you solve a problem that you have already tried and failed to solve?
- What is your source control strategy?
- How would you validate your solution? 
- How would you rapid prototype an idea?
- Someone found a bug in your code. How would you fix a bug in your code?

What are your thoughts on:

- What do you think the future of programming and the web is?
- What is your most controversial technical opinion?
- What 3 things do you look for in a company before you take the job?

- What do you think the future of programming, design and the web is?

- If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?
- How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?)
- What is your favorite feature in Internet Explorer?

Soft Skills:

- Pretending I know nothing, Explain to me how does the internet work?
- What was the last new tech-related skill that you learned? Why? How?
- Explain to me how to use a seat belt.
- What do you do when someone disagrees with your idea?

## Tech Specific Questions
These are a healthy mix of technical level questions, spanning from entry to senior. So you probably won't know all the answers. Moreover, that is okay. Use these as a guide to see what kinds of things software developers should expect to hear during interviews. When learning the answers, it's essential to not only know what is going on but also to create some code sample to explore the concepts. 

For example, for `javascript` => `- Explain == vs. ===`, create a small script that demonstrates to yourself, that you know they are mean, and not just pulling up textbook answers.
