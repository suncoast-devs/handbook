In your first assignment, you will end up with a web page, no matter how simple,
published on the web.

You will create a simple website that will showcase one of your passions. This
is not about making the website flashy, but more about focusing on creating a
website and learning your new tools.

- Write some HTML
- Publish a web page

- [ ] Put your short essay into an HTML page, using appropriate semantic HTML
      elements. Give your webpage a simple header and footer as well. Do not
      apply any style to your page.
