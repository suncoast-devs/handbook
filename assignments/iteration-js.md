## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

- Demonstrate understanding of iteration/enumeration

## Instructions

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/js-iteration) to your own account.
2. Change into your projects directory:
3. Clone your repository: `hub clone js-iteration`
4. Change into your project's directory: `cd js-iteration`
5. Install the dependencies: `yarn install` (or just `yarn` for short)
6. Open in your editor]
7. Start the test runner: `yarn test`
8. Open `src/functions.test.js` and work on functions until tests pass.
9. Commit and push your work to GitHub.
10. Turn in the URL to your GitHub repo.

## Explorer Mode

- All tests passing

## Epic Mode

- Using the `forEach` looping method and no other looping or enumeration helper, write your **own version** of the following methods, except name yours `_map`,
  `_filter`, etc.
  - `map`
  - `filter`
  - `reduce`
  - `every`
  - `some`
- Write some example usage of your new methods to demonstrate that they work
