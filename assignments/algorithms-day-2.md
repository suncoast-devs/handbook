title: Hello, Algorithms!

Welcome to your journey as a developer. One of the core tasks a devloper does is generate algorithms. In this assignment we'll practice breaking down problem statements into algorithms.

## Objectives

- Begin working with algorithmic thinking

## Requirements

Write your answers in a _text_ file on your computer. If you have `Visual Studio Code` installed, feel free to use it. Otherwise use `Notepad` or `TextEdit`.

### Language

In the following problems you are allowed to use the following sentences as your _language_

```
Make a memory spot with the label ____.

Turn over the scrabble tile at position ____, copy the letter to a memory spot labeled ____, turn the tile back over.

Put the number ____ in the memory spot labeled ____.

Add `1` to the value of the number at memory spot labeled ____.

If the value in memory spot with label is ____ then do the next step, otherwise skip the next step.

STOP with the answer YES

STOP with the answer NO
```

### Explorer Mode

- For each of the following your algorithm has to work for _ANY_ length of scrabble tiles. I'll be trying your algorithms with many different sample sizes

- Write an algorithm for: `Given list of "N" scrabble tiles and a starting letter, does it make a sequence?`

  - For example. "Given a list of 4 scrabble tiles and the starting letter of C, does it make a sequence". Try it with some scrabble tiles where this is true (ex C, D, E, F) and some where it does not (C, D, M, P)

- Write an algorithm for: `Given a list of "N" scrabble tiles, does a tile appear twice?`

  - For example, "Given a list of 4 scrabble tiles, does a tile appear twice?" Try it with the sequence (A, M, B, D) and expect a NO, try it with the sequence (A, M, Z, M) and expect the answer YES.

- Write an algorithm for: `Given a list of "N" scrabble tiles, are there as many vowels as consonants?`
  - For example, "Given a list of 6 scrabble tiles, are there as many vowels as consonants?" Try it with (A, Q, I, M, P, E) for a YES, and (A, E, I, O, U, X) and an answer of NO.
  - I'll let you decide if "Y" is a vowel or not.
  - If you want extra bonus points, only count Y if it is the last letter in the sequence!

### Adventure Mode

- Write an algorithm for: `Given list of "N" scrabble tiles, does it make any sequence?`
