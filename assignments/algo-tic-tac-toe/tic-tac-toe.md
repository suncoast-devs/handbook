# Implementing Tic-Tac-Toe

With a partner, create a design for a tic-tac-toe game. Practice your technical design skills (i.e. thinking about _how_ you would code this).

## Objectives

- Plan and design "ideas"
- Collaborate and communicate effectively around technical ideas
- Implement code together with a partner

## Requirements

Features to consider:

- [ ] Game should be played on the same computer.
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to see a tic-tac-toe board.
- [ ] As a user, the game should alternate turns, between `X` and `O`.
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to click in a square and play either `X` or `O`, respective of the turn.
- [ ] As a user, when I get three in a row, I should be told I've won and the game should be over.

**TIPS:**

- These designs should be so detailed that you could give them another team and they could implement it with few (if any) questions.
- If at any time you want to validate a piece of your design (e.g. the algorithm, event handling, or UI/UX), you can create an _extremely simple_ site that proves or disproves your idea.

### Explorer Mode

WITH your partner: submit a full design of how to approach this problem. This should include:

- [ ] A digital mock up (created using software, or a photo/scan of an analog drawing)
- [ ] Implementation details, such as how you are implementing each square
- [ ] A list of events you are listening for
- [ ] _psuedo-code_ describing your program (e.g. event-handling, game logic)

Finally, also with your partner:

- [ ] Create your tic-tac-toe game!

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Plan the implementation of a "vs computer" mode, that picks a random square.

_or_

- [ ] Have fun with the CSS by adding colors, animations and effects to make the game more enjoyable.

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Modify your "vs computer" mode to follow a specific strategy (of your choice).
