# Capstone Week Three

Here are the items you should be working on this week:

1. Review, improve, finalize the look and feel of your application.
1. Create a good README describing your project.
1. Deploy your app to Heroku. Setup a vanity domain if you'd like, though this is _NOT_ required.
1. Configuring the application to restrict actions based on the user (e.g. only logged in users can create a review, etc.)
1. Geolocating data (adding restaurants to a map)
1. Uploading images (adding an image to the user's profile and to the restaurant)
1. Other techniques your specific capstone may need
