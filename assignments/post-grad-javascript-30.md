[JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)

We recommend coding every day (well, say every week day) to continue to build your skills. In JavaScript a great way to practice is Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 program.

From the website:

> Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library.

> We steer clear of opinionated design patterns, frameworks, libraries and any type of abstraction. These things are great and often needed, but can obstruct learning and constrain initial understanding.

## Objectives

- Reinforce JavaScript

### Explorer Mode

- Implement each of the JavaScript 30 projects
- Create a repository for each, or one repository for all 30
- _Deploy_ each of the projects so you may put some of them in your portfolio
