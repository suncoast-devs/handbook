# Let's get started

Today, we are starting our journey into development. This journey has to start somewhere. For this assignment, you will be making a program that demonstrates some programming fundamentals.

## Objectives

- Ensure your development environment is setup
- Practice creating variables
- Practice working with user input

## Requirements

Make sure you have followed the [setup instructions](lesson://cs-environment-setup) for your computer's operating system

Follow [this guide](lesson://cs-how-to-create-and-run-programs) to review how to create and run `C#` applications

All your code should place inside the `static void Main(string args[])`

### Setup

```shell
dotnet new sdg-console -o VariablesCS
```

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Create a new app that does the following.

  - Practice Creating Variables

    - Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) that stores the `numberOfCupsOfCoffee` that you drink every day.
    - Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) called `fullName` and set it equal to your full name.
    - Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) called `today` and set it equal to today's date.
    - Use `Console.WriteLine` and your variables, `numberOfCupsOfCoffee`, `fullName`, and `today`, to output all three on one line.

  - Practice Getting Input From the User

    - Ask the user for their name and store it in a variable named `userName`.
    - Print out a greeting to the user, using their name.

  - Practice Getting Different Types of Input From the User

    - Ask the user to input two numbers.
    - Get the numbers as `string`s using `Console.ReadLine`, store them in variables named `firstNumberAsString` and `secondNumberAsString`

  - Converting String Input Into Numbers

    - Convert each `string` above to a `double` using [double.Parse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.double.Parse?view=netcore-3.1). Save the first value in a variable named `firstOperand` and the second value in a variable named `secondOperand`.

  - Doing Math

    - Add the operand variables from above and save the results in a variable named `sum`.
    - Subtract the `secondOperand` variable from the `firstOperand` variable and save the results in a variable named `difference`.
    - Multiply the operand variables and save the results in a variable named `product`.
    - Divide the `firstOperand` by the `secondOperand` and save the results in a variable named `quotient`.
    - Find the remainder when one operand is divided by the other and save the results in a variable named `remainder`. See [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/arithmetic-operators#remainder-operator-) if you need to learn more about the modulo operator.
    - Use `Console.WriteLine` to present the user, in a meaningful way, each of the values for the `sum`, `difference`, `quotient`, `product`, and `remainder` variables. (e.g. perhaps one of your outputs is similar to `If you add 4 and 5 you get 9` if `4` and `5` were the input)

### Adventure Mode

- Using Logic
  - [ ] Add some _logic_ to your program that prints a different, special, greeting to the user if their name happens to be `Alice`.
- Using Advanced Types
  - [ ] Use the type [DateTime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime?view=netcore-3.1) to represent the data variables.

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Move all of your code to separate method (but keep it in the same file) and invoke it from the `Main` method.
