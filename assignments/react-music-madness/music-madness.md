# Music Madness

For tonight, I want you to show off what you favorite music is. You will be creating a multiple page app, using react-router.

## Objectives

- Create a SPA, with a few pages
- Deploying your website

## Requirements

- Build a website that has 4 pages.
  - 1 landing
  - a page for your top three favorite bands.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Add `react-router-dom` to your project.
- [ ] Create a Landing page that displays a short description of all three of your bands
- [ ] Build 3 band pages. These pages should have a
  - [ ] a band picture
  - [ ] band name
  - [ ] Latest Album information
- [ ] Each page should have a nav bar that allows the user to browse from page to page
- [ ] Deploy your site

_TIP_: for Explorer mode focus on getting the router set up and linking up the pages to each other.

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Instead of hard coding the URL, try to use parameters, components and JSON file to supply navigation for your site.

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Add integrations from [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api). This API has a bunch of features. Go crazy, the sky is the limit.

## Additional Resources
